| **[NATLM: Detecting Defects in NFT Smart Contracts Leveraging LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01351v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets, they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base. Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed 8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%, a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Hijacking: Subverting LLM Classification via Decision-Criteria Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10294v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM safety research predominantly focuses on mitigating Goal Hijacking, preventing attackers from redirecting a model's high-level objective (e.g., from "summarizing emails" to "phishing users"). In this paper, we argue that this perspective is incomplete and highlight a critical vulnerability in Reasoning Alignment. We propose a new adversarial paradigm: Reasoning Hijacking and instantiate it with Criteria Attack, which subverts model judgments by injecting spurious decision criteria without altering the high-level task goal. Unlike Goal Hijacking, which attempts to override the system prompt, Reasoning Hijacking accepts the high-level goal but manipulates the model's decision-making logic by injecting spurious reasoning shortcut. Though extensive experiments on three different tasks (toxic comment, negative review, and spam detection), we demonstrate that even newest models are prone to prioritize injected heuristic shortcuts over rigorous semantic analysis. The results are consistent over different backbones. Crucially, because the model's "intent" remains aligned with the user's instructions, these attacks can bypass defenses designed to detect goal deviation (e.g., SecAlign, StruQ), exposing a fundamental blind spot in the current safety landscape.

| **[ToolSafe: Enhancing Tool Invocation Safety of LLM-based agents via Proactive Step-level Guardrail and Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10156v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in Progress.

| **[STELP: Secure Transpilation and Execution of LLM-Generated Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05467v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and Preserving Safety in Fine-Tuned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10141v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination. In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MindGuard: Intrinsic Decision Inspection for Securing LLM Agents Against Metadata Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20412v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is increasingly adopted to standardize the interaction between LLM agents and external tools. However, this trend introduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is poisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing defenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally ineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no behavioral trace to monitor. Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents, providing provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and poisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision remains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation between LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we choose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize this as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning process as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts and edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust DDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently detect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\%-99\% average precision in detecting poisoned invocations, 95\%-100\% attribution accuracy, with processing times under one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as an adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a solid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision level.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Privacy-aware LLM in Healthcare: Threat Model, Privacy Techniques, Challenges and Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10004v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in healthcare to support clinical decision-making, summarize electronic health records (EHRs), and enhance patient care. However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities. While existing defenses show promise, our analysis identifies persistent limitations in securing sensitive clinical data across diverse operational tiers. We conclude with phase-aware recommendations and future research directions aimed at strengthening privacy guarantees for LLMs in regulated environments. This work provides a foundation for understanding the intersection of LLMs, threats, and privacy in healthcare, offering a roadmap toward more robust and clinically trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIGIL: Defending LLM Agents Against Tool Stream Injection via Verify-Before-Commit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05755v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents operating in open environments face escalating risks from indirect prompt injection, particularly within the tool stream where manipulated metadata and runtime feedback hijack execution flow. Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Burn-After-Use for Preventing Data Leakage through a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture in Enterprise LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06627v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture (SMTA) combined with a novel concept Burn-After-Use (BAU) mechanism for enterprise LLM environments to effectively prevent data leakage. As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SpatialJB: How Text Distribution Art Becomes the "Jailbreak Key" for LLM Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09321v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have powerful capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which is a critical barrier to their safe web real-time application. Current commercial LLM providers deploy output guardrails to filter harmful outputs, yet these defenses are not impenetrable. Due to LLMs' reliance on autoregressive, token-by-token inference, their semantic representations lack robustness to spatially structured perturbations, such as redistributing tokens across different rows, columns, or diagonals. Exploiting the Transformer's spatial weakness, we propose SpatialJB to disrupt the model's output generation process, allowing harmful content to bypass guardrails without detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on leading LLMs get nearly 100% ASR, demonstrating the high effectiveness of SpatialJB. Even after adding advanced output guardrails, like the OpenAI Moderation API, SpatialJB consistently maintains a success rate exceeding 75%, outperforming current jailbreak techniques by a significant margin. The proposal of SpatialJB exposes a key weakness in current guardrails and emphasizes the importance of spatial semantics, offering new insights to advance LLM safety research. To prevent potential misuse, we also present baseline defense strategies against SpatialJB and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating such attacks. The code for the attack, baseline defenses, and a demo are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpatialJailbreak-8E63.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.</p></details> |  |

Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

However, these advancements have introduced significant security risks, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. Politically harmful content, such as fabricated depictions of public figures, poses severe threats when weaponized for fake news or propaganda. Despite its criticality, the robustness of current T2I safety filters against such politically motivated adversarial prompting remains underexplored. In response, we propose $PC^2$, the first black-box political jailbreaking framework for T2I models. It exploits a novel vulnerability where safety filters evaluate political sensitivity based on linguistic context. $PC^2$ operates through: (1) Identity-Preserving Descriptive Mapping to obfuscate sensitive keywords into neutral descriptions, and (2) Geopolitically Distal Translation to map these descriptions into fragmented, low-sensitivity languages. This strategy prevents filters from constructing toxic relationships between political entities within prompts, effectively bypassing detection. We construct a benchmark of 240 politically sensitive prompts involving 36 public figures. Evaluation on commercial T2I models, specifically GPT-series, shows that while all original prompts are blocked, $PC^2$ achieves attack success rates of up to 86%.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Refinement of Universal Multimodal Attacks on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10313v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MLAAD: The Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09512v9)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology offers notable benefits, such as providing a voice for individuals with speech impairments, but it also facilitates the creation of audio deepfakes and spoofing attacks. AI-based detection methods can help mitigate these risks; however, the performance of such models is inherently dependent on the quality and diversity of their training data. Presently, the available datasets are heavily skewed towards English and Chinese audio, which limits the global applicability of these anti-spoofing systems. To address this limitation, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset (MLAAD), version 9, created using 140 TTS models, comprising 78 different architectures, to generate 678,3 hours of synthetic voice in 51 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD and observe that it demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild and Fake-Or-Real when used as a training resource. Moreover, compared to the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, each excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD and making a trained model accessible via an interactive webserver, we aim to democratize anti-spoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of specialists, and contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and deepfakes.</p></details> | IJCNN 2024 |

However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities. While existing defenses show promise, our analysis identifies persistent limitations in securing sensitive clinical data across diverse operational tiers. We conclude with phase-aware recommendations and future research directions aimed at strengthening privacy guarantees for LLMs in regulated environments. This work provides a foundation for understanding the intersection of LLMs, threats, and privacy in healthcare, offering a roadmap toward more robust and clinically trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Secondary Risks of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12382v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulated Ensemble Attack: Transferring Jailbreaks Across Fine-tuned Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01741v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread practice of fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises a critical security concern: jailbreak vulnerabilities in base models may persist in downstream variants, enabling transferable attacks across fine-tuned systems. To investigate this risk, we propose the Simulated Ensemble Attack (SEA), a grey-box jailbreak framework that assumes full access to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target. SEA enhances transferability via Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS), which models bounded parameter variations in the vision encoder, and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG), which stabilizes adversarial optimization through auxiliary textual guidance. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family demonstrate that SEA achieves consistently high transfer success and toxicity rates across diverse fine-tuned variants, including safety-enhanced models, while standard PGD-based image jailbreaks exhibit negligible transferability. Further analysis reveals that fine-tuning primarily induces localized parameter shifts around the base model, explaining why attacks optimized over a simulated neighborhood transfer effectively. We also show that SEA generalizes across different base generations (e.g., Qwen2.5/3-VL), indicating that its effectiveness arises from shared fine-tuning-induced behaviors rather than architecture- or initialization-specific factors.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces WAMM, an AI-driven multiclass web attack detection framework designed to reveal the limitations of rule-based systems by reclassifying HTTP requests into OWASP-aligned categories for a specific technology stack. WAMM applies a multi-phase enhancement pipeline to the SR-BH 2020 dataset that includes large-scale deduplication, LLM-guided relabeling, realistic attack data augmentation, and LLM-based filtering, producing three refined datasets. Four machine and deep learning models are evaluated using a unified feature space built from statistical and text-based representations. Results show that using an augmented and LLM-filtered dataset on the same technology stack, XGBoost reaches 99.59% accuracy with microsecond-level inference while deep learning models degrade under noisy augmentation. When tested against OWASP CRS using an unseen augmented dataset, WAMM achieves true positive block rates between 96 and 100% with improvements of up to 86%. These findings expose gaps in widely deployed rule-based defenses and demonstrate that curated training pipelines combined with efficient machine learning models enable a more resilient, real-time approach to web attack detection suitable for production WAF environments.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.</p></details> |  |
