| **[SafeScientist: Toward Risk-Aware Scientific Discoveries by LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23559v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component. Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts, comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30 specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/SafeScientist. \textcolor{red}{Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Readable Adversarial Prompts: An Investigation into LLM Vulnerabilities Using Situational Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16359v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the AI systems become deeply embedded in social media platforms, we've uncovered a concerning security vulnerability that goes beyond traditional adversarial attacks. It becomes important to assess the risks of LLMs before the general public use them on social media platforms to avoid any adverse impacts. Unlike obvious nonsensical text strings that safety systems can easily catch, our work reveals that human-readable situation-driven adversarial full-prompts that leverage situational context are effective but much harder to detect. We found that skilled attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs to make a malicious user query safe for LLMs, resulting in generating a harmful response. This raises an important question about the vulnerabilities of LLMs. To measure the robustness against human-readable attacks, which now present a potent threat, our research makes three major contributions. First, we developed attacks that use movie scripts as situational contextual frameworks, creating natural-looking full-prompts that trick LLMs into generating harmful content. Second, we developed a method to transform gibberish adversarial text into readable, innocuous content that still exploits vulnerabilities when used within the full-prompts. Finally, we enhanced the AdvPrompter framework with p-nucleus sampling to generate diverse human-readable adversarial texts that significantly improve attack effectiveness against models like GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 and Gemma-7b. Our findings show that these systems can be manipulated to operate beyond their intended ethical boundaries when presented with seemingly normal prompts that contain hidden adversarial elements. By identifying these vulnerabilities, we aim to drive the development of more robust safety mechanisms that can withstand sophisticated attacks in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.14644</p></details> |

Benchmarking Adversarial Compositionality of Pre-trained Multimodal Representation via Text Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22943v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main.

| **[Permissioned LLMs: Enforcing Access Control in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22860v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP), in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for quantifying access control in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operationalizing CaMeL: Strengthening LLM Defenses for Enterprise Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22852v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning) introduces a capability-based sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language model (LLM) agents. While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees. Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security and support scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Aloe Family Recipe for Open and Specialized Healthcare LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04388v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare, the need arises for competitive open-source models to protect the public interest. This work contributes to the field of open medical LLMs by optimizing key stages of data preprocessing and training, while showing how to improve model safety (through DPO) and efficacy (through RAG). The evaluation methodology used, which includes four different types of tests, defines a new standard for the field. The resultant models, shown to be competitive with the best private alternatives, are released with a permisive license. Methods: Building on top of strong base models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5, Aloe Beta uses a custom dataset to enhance public data with synthetic Chain of Thought examples. The models undergo alignment with Direct Preference Optimization, emphasizing ethical and policy-aligned performance in the presence of jailbreaking attacks. Evaluation includes close-ended, open-ended, safety and human assessments, to maximize the reliability of results. Results: Recommendations are made across the entire pipeline, backed by the solid performance of the Aloe Family. These models deliver competitive performance across healthcare benchmarks and medical fields, and are often preferred by healthcare professionals. On bias and toxicity, the Aloe Beta models significantly improve safety, showing resilience to unseen jailbreaking attacks. For a responsible release, a detailed risk assessment specific to healthcare is attached to the Aloe Family models. Conclusion: The Aloe Beta models, and the recipe that leads to them, are a significant contribution to the open-source medical LLM field, offering top-of-the-line performance while maintaining high ethical requirements. This work sets a new standard for developing and reporting aligned LLMs in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Follo...</summary><p>Follow-up work from arXiv:2405.01886</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Detoxification: Safeguarding General Capabilities of LLMs through Toxicity-Aware Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22298v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language capabilities but remain vulnerable to malicious prompts and jailbreaking attacks. Existing knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges. First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries, compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks. Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Beyond Surface-Level Patterns: An Essence-Driven Defense Framework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19041v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful requests, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying "attack essence" remains the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, ACL 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[MedSentry: Understanding and Mitigating Safety Risks in Medical LLM Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20824v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in healthcare, ensuring their safety, particularly within collaborative multi-agent configurations, is paramount. In this paper we introduce MedSentry, a benchmark comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with 100 subthemes. Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents. Our findings reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying vulnerability mechanisms. For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation. To mitigate these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to near-baseline levels. MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards LLM Unlearning Resilient to Relearning Attacks: A Sharpness-Aware Minimization Perspective and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05374v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

However, due to potential vulnerabilities in models available on open-source platforms, model merging is susceptible to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose Merge Hijacking, the first backdoor attack targeting model merging in LLMs. The attacker constructs a malicious upload model and releases it. Once a victim user merges it with any other models, the resulting merged model inherits the backdoor while maintaining utility across tasks. Merge Hijacking defines two main objectives-effectiveness and utility-and achieves them through four steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack across different models, merging algorithms, and tasks. Additionally, we show that the attack remains effective even when merging real-world models. Moreover, our attack demonstrates robustness against two inference-time defenses (Paraphrasing and CLEANGEN) and one training-time defense (Fine-pruning).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hijacking Large Language Models via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09948v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm leveraging LLMs for specific downstream tasks by utilizing labeled examples as demonstrations (demos) in the preconditioned prompts. Despite its promising performance, crafted adversarial attacks pose a notable threat to the robustness of LLMs. Existing attacks are either easy to detect, require a trigger in user input, or lack specificity towards ICL. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel transferable prompt injection attack against ICL, aiming to hijack LLMs to generate the target output or elicit harmful responses. In our threat model, the hacker acts as a model publisher who leverages a gradient-based prompt search method to learn and append imperceptible adversarial suffixes to the in-context demos via prompt injection. We also propose effective defense strategies using a few shots of clean demos, enhancing the robustness of LLMs during ICL.

| **[Learning to Poison Large Language Models for Downstream Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13459v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked significant achievements in language processing and reasoning capabilities. Despite their advancements, LLMs face vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where the adversary inserts backdoor triggers into training data to manipulate outputs. This work further identifies additional security risks in LLMs by designing a new data poisoning attack tailored to exploit the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process. We propose a novel gradient-guided backdoor trigger learning (GBTL) algorithm to identify adversarial triggers efficiently, ensuring an evasion of detection by conventional defenses while maintaining content integrity. Through experimental validation across various language model tasks, including sentiment analysis, domain generation, and question answering, our poisoning strategy demonstrates a high success rate in compromising various LLMs' outputs. We further propose two defense strategies against data poisoning attacks, including in-context learning (ICL) and continuous learning (CL), which effectively rectify the behavior of LLMs and significantly reduce the decline in performance. Our work highlights the significant security risks present during SFT of LLMs and the necessity of safeguarding LLMs against data poisoning attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, the security issues associated with these models are becoming increasingly severe. Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELMAN: Dynamic Defense Against Large Language Model Jailbreaking with Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11647v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in decision making, but their deployment is threatened by jailbreak attacks, where adversarial users manipulate model behavior to bypass safety measures. Existing defense mechanisms, such as safety fine-tuning and model editing, either require extensive parameter modifications or lack precision, leading to performance degradation on general tasks, which is unsuitable to post-deployment safety alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DELMAN (Dynamic Editing for LLMs JAilbreak DefeNse), a novel approach leveraging direct model editing for precise, dynamic protection against jailbreak attacks. DELMAN directly updates a minimal set of relevant parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving the model's utility. To avoid triggering a safe response in benign context, we incorporate KL-divergence regularization to ensure the updated model remains consistent with the original model when processing benign queries. Experimental results demonstrate that DELMAN outperforms baseline methods in mitigating jailbreak attacks while preserving the model's utility, and adapts seamlessly to new attack instances, providing a practical and efficient solution for post-deployment model protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness-Congruent Adversarial Training for Secure Machine Learning Model Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17390v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learning models demand periodic updates to improve their average accuracy, exploiting novel architectures and additional data. However, a newly updated model may commit mistakes the previous model did not make. Such misclassifications are referred to as negative flips, experienced by users as a regression of performance. In this work, we show that this problem also affects robustness to adversarial examples, hindering the development of secure model update practices. In particular, when updating a model to improve its adversarial robustness, previously ineffective adversarial attacks on some inputs may become successful, causing a regression in the perceived security of the system. We propose a novel technique, named robustness-congruent adversarial training, to address this issue. It amounts to fine-tuning a model with adversarial training, while constraining it to retain higher robustness on the samples for which no adversarial example was found before the update. We show that our algorithm and, more generally, learning with non-regression constraints, provides a theoretically-grounded framework to train consistent estimators. Our experiments on robust models for computer vision confirm that both accuracy and robustness, even if improved after model update, can be affected by negative flips, and our robustness-congruent adversarial training can mitigate the problem, outperforming competing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

These attacks compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly improves the success rate of jailbreaking.

Video Generative Models are Experts on Controllable Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23325v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models can be regarded as world simulators due to their ability to capture dynamic, continuous changes inherent in real-world environments. These models integrate high-dimensional information across visual, temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions, enabling predictions of subjects in various status. A natural and valuable research direction is to explore whether a fully trained video generative model in high-dimensional space can effectively support lower-dimensional tasks such as controllable image generation. In this work, we propose a paradigm for video-to-image knowledge compression and task adaptation, termed \textit{Dimension-Reduction Attack} (\texttt{DRA-Ctrl}), which utilizes the strengths of video models, including long-range context modeling and flatten full-attention, to perform various generation tasks. Specially, to address the challenging gap between continuous video frames and discrete image generation, we introduce a mixup-based transition strategy that ensures smooth adaptation. Moreover, we redesign the attention structure with a tailored masking mechanism to better align text prompts with image-level control. Experiments across diverse image generation tasks, such as subject-driven and spatially conditioned generation, show that repurposed video models outperform those trained directly on images. These results highlight the untapped potential of large-scale video generators for broader visual applications. \texttt{DRA-Ctrl} provides new insights into reusing resource-intensive video models and lays foundation for future unified generative models across visual modalities.

Large language models (LLMs) show promise in providing such natural language interpretations of data, yet simple feature extraction methods such as prompting often fail to produce accurate and versatile descriptions for diverse datasets and lack control over granularity and scale. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic method for dataset featurization that provides precise control over the number of features extracted while maintaining compact and descriptive representations comparable to human labeling. Our method optimizes the selection of informative binary features by evaluating the ability of an LLM to reconstruct the original data using those features. We demonstrate its effectiveness in dataset modeling tasks and through two case studies: (1) Constructing a feature representation of jailbreak tactics that compactly captures both the effectiveness and diversity of a larger set of human-crafted attacks; and (2) automating the discovery of features that align with human preferences, achieving accuracy and robustness comparable to human-crafted features. Moreover, we show that the pipeline scales effectively, improving as additional features are sampled, making it suitable for large and diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, due to potential vulnerabilities in models available on open-source platforms, model merging is susceptible to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose Merge Hijacking, the first backdoor attack targeting model merging in LLMs. The attacker constructs a malicious upload model and releases it. Once a victim user merges it with any other models, the resulting merged model inherits the backdoor while maintaining utility across tasks. Merge Hijacking defines two main objectives-effectiveness and utility-and achieves them through four steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack across different models, merging algorithms, and tasks. Additionally, we show that the attack remains effective even when merging real-world models. Moreover, our attack demonstrates robustness against two inference-time defenses (Paraphrasing and CLEANGEN) and one training-time defense (Fine-pruning).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[SGD Jittering: A Training Strategy for Robust and Accurate Model-Based Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14667v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems aim to reconstruct unseen data from corrupted or perturbed measurements. While most work focuses on improving reconstruction quality, generalization accuracy and robustness are equally important, especially for safety-critical applications. Model-based architectures (MBAs), such as loop unrolling methods, are considered more interpretable and achieve better reconstructions. Empirical evidence suggests that MBAs are more robust to perturbations than black-box solvers, but the accuracy-robustness tradeoff in MBAs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training scheme for MBAs, called SGD jittering, which injects noise iteration-wise during reconstruction. We theoretically demonstrate that SGD jittering not only generalizes better than the standard mean squared error training but is also more robust to average-case attacks. We validate SGD jittering using denoising toy examples, seismic deconvolution, and single-coil MRI reconstruction. Both SGD jittering and its SPGD extension yield cleaner reconstructions for out-of-distribution data and demonstrates enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hijacking Large Language Models via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09948v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm leveraging LLMs for specific downstream tasks by utilizing labeled examples as demonstrations (demos) in the preconditioned prompts. Despite its promising performance, crafted adversarial attacks pose a notable threat to the robustness of LLMs. Existing attacks are either easy to detect, require a trigger in user input, or lack specificity towards ICL. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel transferable prompt injection attack against ICL, aiming to hijack LLMs to generate the target output or elicit harmful responses. In our threat model, the hacker acts as a model publisher who leverages a gradient-based prompt search method to learn and append imperceptible adversarial suffixes to the in-context demos via prompt injection. We also propose effective defense strategies using a few shots of clean demos, enhancing the robustness of LLMs during ICL. Extensive experimental results across various classification and jailbreak tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack and defense strategies. This work highlights the significant security vulnerabilities of LLMs during ICL and underscores the need for further in-depth studies.</p></details> |  |
