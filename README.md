| **[CAVGAN: Unifying Jailbreak and Defense of LLMs via Generative Adversarial Attacks on their Internal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06043v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense. Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%. This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for enhancing model security The code and data are available at https://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN.</p></details> |  |

Current security analysis methodologies in vulnerability detection can be categorized into static analysis and dynamic analysis methods.However, these existing traditional vulnerability detection methods predominantly rely on analyzing original contract code, not all smart contracts provide accessible code.We present ETrace, a novel event-driven vulnerability detection framework for smart contracts, which uniquely identifies potential vulnerabilities through LLM-powered trace analysis without requiring source code access. By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic interpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning. ETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between transaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of ETrace through preliminary experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Feint and Attack: Attention-Based Strategies for Jailbreaking and Protecting LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16327v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attack can be used to access the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by inducing LLMs to generate the harmful content. And the most common method of the attack is to construct semantically ambiguous prompts to confuse and mislead the LLMs. To access the security and reveal the intrinsic relation between the input prompt and the output for LLMs, the distribution of attention weight is introduced to analyze the underlying reasons. By using statistical analysis methods, some novel metrics are defined to better describe the distribution of attention weight, such as the Attention Intensity on Sensitive Words (Attn_SensWords), the Attention-based Contextual Dependency Score (Attn_DepScore) and Attention Dispersion Entropy (Attn_Entropy). By leveraging the distinct characteristics of these metrics, the beam search algorithm and inspired by the military strategy "Feint and Attack", an effective jailbreak attack strategy named as Attention-Based Attack (ABA) is proposed. In the ABA, nested attack prompts are employed to divert the attention distribution of the LLMs. In this manner, more harmless parts of the input can be used to attract the attention of the LLMs. In addition, motivated by ABA, an effective defense strategy called as Attention-Based Defense (ABD) is also put forward. Compared with ABA, the ABD can be used to enhance the robustness of LLMs by calibrating the attention distribution of the input prompt. Some comparative experiments have been given to demonstrate the effectiveness of ABA and ABD. Therefore, both ABA and ABD can be used to access the security of the LLMs. The comparative experiment results also give a logical explanation that the distribution of attention weight can bring great influence on the output for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Not to Detect Prompt Injections with an LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05630v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascade: Token-Sharded Private LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05228v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ICML 2025 Main Proceedings as "Hidden No More: Attacking and Defending Private Third-Party LLM Inference", together with arXiv:2505.18332</p></details> |
| **[Who's the Mole? Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety.

| **[Tail-aware Adversarial Attacks: A Distributional Approach to Efficient LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04446v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions. Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Slipping: A Mechanistic Understanding of Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04365v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat. However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks: Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning. Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening, a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2) show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Blackbox Dataset Inference for LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03619v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the training of large language models (LLMs) can involve personally identifiable information and copyrighted material, incurring dataset misuse. To mitigate the problem of dataset misuse, this paper explores \textit{dataset inference}, which aims to detect if a suspect model $\mathcal{M}$ used a victim dataset $\mathcal{D}$ in training. Previous research tackles dataset inference by aggregating results of membership inference attacks (MIAs) -- methods to determine whether individual samples are a part of the training dataset. However, restricted by the low accuracy of MIAs, previous research mandates grey-box access to $\mathcal{M}$ to get intermediate outputs (probabilities, loss, perplexity, etc.) for obtaining satisfactory results. This leads to reduced practicality, as LLMs, especially those deployed for profits, have limited incentives to return the intermediate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new method of dataset inference with only black-box access to the target model (i.e., assuming only the text-based responses of the target model are available). Our method is enabled by two sets of locally built reference models, one set involving $\mathcal{D}$ in training and the other not. By measuring which set of reference model $\mathcal{M}$ is closer to, we determine if $\mathcal{M}$ used $\mathcal{D}$ for training. Evaluations of real-world LLMs in the wild show that our method offers high accuracy in all settings and presents robustness against bypassing attempts.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  |

In particular, explainability techniques, such as counterfactual explanations, inadvertently increase the risk of model extraction attacks, enabling unauthorized replication of proprietary models. In this paper, we formalize and characterize the risks and inherent complexity of model reconstruction, focusing on the "oracle'' queries required for faithfully inferring the underlying prediction function. We present the first formal analysis of model extraction attacks through the lens of competitive analysis, establishing a foundational framework to evaluate their efficiency. Focusing on models based on additive decision trees (e.g., decision trees, gradient boosting, and random forests), we introduce novel reconstruction algorithms that achieve provably perfect fidelity while demonstrating strong anytime performance. Our framework provides theoretical bounds on the query complexity for extracting tree-based model, offering new insights into the security vulnerabilities of their deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose MEF, a capability-aware multi-encryption framework for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Our key insight is that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies can be significantly enhanced by tailoring them to the semantic comprehension capabilities of the target model. We present a typology that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II based on their comprehension levels, and design adaptive attack strategies for each. MEF combines layered semantic mutations and dual-ended encryption techniques, enabling circumvention of input, inference, and output-level defenses.

We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the attack success rate while preserving model capabilities.

Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety.

However, this reliance introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational context integrity.</p></details> |  |

Producing chips in a third-party manufacturing company can let hackers change the design. As the Internet of Things (IoT) proliferates, physical attacks happen more, and conventional cryptography techniques do not function well. In this paper, we investigate the design and assessment of PUFs using the Stanford Memristor Model, utilizing its random filament evolution to improve security. The system was built using 45nm CMOS technology. A comparison is made between CMOS-based and memristor-based Arbiter PUFs, evaluating their performance under temperature, voltage, and process variations. Intra- and inter-hamming distances are employed by Monte Carlo simulations to estimate uniqueness and reliability. The results show that memristor-based PUFs offer better reliability than CMOS-based designs, though uniqueness needs further improvement. Furthermore, this study sheds light on the reasonableness of memristor-based PUFs for secure applications in hardware security.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional analysis methods, including manual inspection and automated tools, struggle with increasingly expanding cellular network specifications. This paper investigates the feasibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated cellular network specification refinement. To advance it, we leverage 200,000+ approved 3GPP Change Requests (CRs) that document specification revisions, constructing a valuable dataset for domain tasks. We introduce CR-eval, a principled evaluation framework, and benchmark 16 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating that top models can discover security-related weaknesses in over 127 out of 200 test cases within five trials. To bridge potential gaps, we explore LLM specialization techniques, including fine-tuning an 8B model to match or surpass advanced LLMs like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1. Evaluations on 30 cellular attacks identify open challenges for achieving full automation. These findings confirm that LLMs can automate the refinement of cellular network specifications and provide valuable insights to guide future research in this direction.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing adversarial attack methods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\ell_{p}$-norm perturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual capabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward generating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to instability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed for UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation injection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on diffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable adversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution towards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map to inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated samples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of natural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but also retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA datasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in both black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality. Furthermore, the dynamic balance between denoising and adversarial perturbation enables ScoreAdv to remain robust even under defensive measures.</p></details> |  |

In particular, explainability techniques, such as counterfactual explanations, inadvertently increase the risk of model extraction attacks, enabling unauthorized replication of proprietary models. In this paper, we formalize and characterize the risks and inherent complexity of model reconstruction, focusing on the "oracle'' queries required for faithfully inferring the underlying prediction function. We present the first formal analysis of model extraction attacks through the lens of competitive analysis, establishing a foundational framework to evaluate their efficiency. Focusing on models based on additive decision trees (e.g., decision trees, gradient boosting, and random forests), we introduce novel reconstruction algorithms that achieve provably perfect fidelity while demonstrating strong anytime performance. Our framework provides theoretical bounds on the query complexity for extracting tree-based model, offering new insights into the security vulnerabilities of their deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose MEF, a capability-aware multi-encryption framework for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Our key insight is that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies can be significantly enhanced by tailoring them to the semantic comprehension capabilities of the target model. We present a typology that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II based on their comprehension levels, and design adaptive attack strategies for each. MEF combines layered semantic mutations and dual-ended encryption techniques, enabling circumvention of input, inference, and output-level defenses. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, it achieves a jailbreak success rate of 98.9\% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release). Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in current LLMs' alignment defenses.</p></details> |  |
