| **[LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness. Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety</p></details> |  |

Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each of which we also present plausible attacks, security evaluation metrics, and future research guidelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generative Approach to LLM Harmfulness Detection with Special Red Flag Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16366v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) are based on fine-tuning that forces models to shift from an unsafe answer to refusal when faced with harmful requests. Unfortunately, these drastic distribution shifts generally compromise model capabilities. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to train the model to insert this token into its response at any time when harmful content is generated or about to be generated. Our approach offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer and provides robustness as good as adversarial training without the need to run attacks during training. Moreover, by encapsulating our safety tuning in a LoRA module, we provide additional defenses against fine-tuning API attacks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-Trigger Poisoning Amplifies Backdoor Vulnerabilities in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11112v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Devil behind the mask: An emergent safety vulnerability of Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11097v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling. However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

| **[From Alerts to Intelligence: A Novel LLM-Aided Framework for Host-based Intrusion Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10873v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is a key defense component to protect the organizations from advanced threats like Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). By analyzing the fine-grained logs with approaches like data provenance, HIDS has shown successes in capturing sophisticated attack traces. Despite the progresses embarked by the research community and industry, HIDS still frequently encounters backlash from their operators in the deployed environments, due to issues like high false-positive rate, inconsistent outcomes across environments and human-unfriendly detection results. Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potentials to advance the state of HIDS, given their extensive knowledge of attack techniques and their ability to detect anomalies through semantic analysis, anchored by recent studies. Yet, our preliminary analysis indicates that building an HIDS by naively prompting an LLM is unlikely to succeed. In this work, we explore the direction of building a customized LLM pipeline for HIDS and develop a system named SHIELD. SHIELD addresses challenges related to LLM's token limits, confusion of background noises, etc., by integrating a variety of techniques like event-level Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for attack window detection, attack evidence identification and expansion, Deterministic Data Augmentation (DDA) for profiling normal activities, and multi-purpose prompting that guides the LLM to conduct precise and interpretable attack investigations. Extensive experiments on three log datasets (DARPA-E3, NodLink-simulated-data and ATLASv2) show that SHIELD consistently achieves outstanding performance in comparison with 5 representative HIDS. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as powerful tools for intrusion detection and pave the way for future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[Bypassing LLM Guardrails: An Empirical Analysis of Evasion Attacks against Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11168v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) guardrail systems are designed to protect against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables.

| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities or adversarial prompting techniques, this study examines a more direct threat scenario: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted either directly or indirectly. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and directness across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives prompts from real vulnerable code samples to assess vulnerability reproduction accuracy. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, and Gemma) using ESBMC static analysis to assess both the presence of vulnerabilities and the correctness of the generated vulnerability type. Results show all models frequently produce vulnerable outputs, with Qwen2 achieving highest correctness rates. User persona significantly affects success, where student personas achieved higher vulnerability rates than professional roles, while direct prompts were marginally more effective. Vulnerability reproduction followed an inverted-U pattern with cyclomatic complexity, peaking at moderate ranges. Our findings expose limitations of safety mechanisms in open-source models, particularly for seemingly benign educational requests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[IPAD: Inverse Prompt for AI Detection -- A Robust and Explainable LLM-Generated Text Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15902v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinction between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide interpretable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and two Distinguishers that examine the probability that the input texts align with the predicted prompts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IPAD outperforms the strongest baselines by 9.05% (Average Recall) on in-distribution data, 12.93% (AUROC) on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and 5.48% (AUROC) on attacked data. IPAD also performs robustly on structured datasets. Furthermore, an interpretability assessment is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.</p></details> |  |

This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstructFLIP: Exploring Unified Vision-Language Model for Face Anti-spoofing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12060v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

| **[Jailbreak-Tuning: Models Efficiently Learn Jailbreak Susceptibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11630v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However, this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks, underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Attackers inject carefully crafted malicious patterns into the training data, misleading the code search model to learn these patterns during training. During the usage of the poisoned code search model for inference, once the malicious pattern is triggered, the model tends to rank the vulnerability code higher. However, existing detection methods for data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models remain insufficiently effective. To address this critical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection Framework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP introduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR) designed to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models. Specifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search queries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as the source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically equivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each source ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its code snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source and re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn the data poisoning attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MT4DP significantly enhances the detection of data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models, outperforming the best baseline by 191% on average F1 score and 265% on average precision. Our work aims to promote further research into effective techniques for mitigating data poisoning threats on DL-based code search models.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Representation Bending for Large Language Model Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01550v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, but their inherent safety risks - ranging from harmful content generation to broader societal harms - pose significant challenges. These risks can be amplified by the recent adversarial attacks, fine-tuning vulnerabilities, and the increasing deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments. Existing safety-enhancing techniques, such as fine-tuning with human feedback or adversarial training, are still vulnerable as they address specific threats and often fail to generalize across unseen attacks, or require manual system-level defenses. This paper introduces RepBend, a novel approach that fundamentally disrupts the representations underlying harmful behaviors in LLMs, offering a scalable solution to enhance (potentially inherent) safety. RepBend brings the idea of activation steering - simple vector arithmetic for steering model's behavior during inference - to loss-based fine-tuning. Through extensive evaluation, RepBend achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods such as Circuit Breaker, RMU, and NPO, with up to 95% reduction in attack success rates across diverse jailbreak benchmarks, all with negligible reduction in model usability and general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

While machine learning has been effective in real-time detection of phishing attacks, progress is hindered by lack of large, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. In addition to poor-quality due to challenges in data collection, existing datasets suffer from leakage and unrealistic base rates, leading to overly optimistic performance results. In this paper, we introduce PhreshPhish, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of phishing websites that addresses these limitations. Compared to existing public datasets, PhreshPhish is substantially larger and provides significantly higher quality, as measured by the estimated rate of invalid or mislabeled data points. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets specifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage, increasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base rates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple solution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We believe the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic, standardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing detection. The datasets and benchmarks are available on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/phreshphish/phreshphish).</p></details> |  |

The models particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the other models</p></details> |  |
| **[3S-Attack: Spatial, Spectral and Semantic Invisible Backdoor Attack Against DNN Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10733v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks involve either poisoning the training data or directly modifying the model in order to implant a hidden behavior, that causes the model to misclassify inputs when a specific trigger is present. During inference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but misclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class. Existing research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the spatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make them stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that are imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated the semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed 3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic domains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as triggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a preliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral domain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back to the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and benign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and human inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with theoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight the need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstructFLIP: Exploring Unified Vision-Language Model for Face Anti-spoofing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12060v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

| **[Jailbreak-Tuning: Models Efficiently Learn Jailbreak Susceptibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11630v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However, this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks, underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its capabilities.</p></details> |  |
