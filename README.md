| **[FLAME: Flexible LLM-Assisted Moderation Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09175v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges in moderating user-model interactions. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly ``jailbreaking'' techniques that bypass content safety measures. Current content moderation systems, which primarily rely on input prompt filtering, have proven insufficient, with techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreaking achieving success rates of 80% or more against popular LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Flexible LLM-Assisted Moderation Engine (FLAME): a new approach that shifts the focus from input filtering to output moderation. Unlike traditional circuit-breaking methods that analyze user queries, FLAME evaluates model responses, offering several key advantages: (1) computational efficiency in both training and inference, (2) enhanced resistance to BoN jailbreaking attacks, and (3) flexibility in defining and updating safety criteria through customizable topic filtering. Our experiments demonstrate that FLAME significantly outperforms current moderation systems. For example, FLAME reduces attack success rate in GPT-4o-mini and DeepSeek-v3 by a factor of ~9, while maintaining low computational overhead. We provide comprehensive evaluation on various LLMs and analyze the engine's efficiency against the state-of-the-art jailbreaking. This work contributes to the development of more robust and adaptable content moderation systems for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Adversarial Attack on Aligned Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07987v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., ''Sure, here it is'') or otherwise unsafe content-even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench benchmark, our method achieves significantly higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 93% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model transferability by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously and testing on unseen architectures. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license. Warning: some content generated by Multimodal LLMs in this paper may be offensive to some readers.</p></details> | Added an affiliation |
| **[Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commercial LLM Agents Are Already Vulnerable to Simple Yet Dangerous Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08586v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A high volume of recent ML security literature focuses on attacks against aligned large language models (LLMs). These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then conduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial agents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their vulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no understanding of machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modification and Generated-Text Detection: Achieving Dual Detection Capabilities for the Outputs of LLM by Watermark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08332v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse. One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction. Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM. This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification. We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection. When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification. Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM Serving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20002v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

| **[Efficient LLM Jailbreak via Adaptive Dense-to-sparse Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09113v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that can generate harmful content. This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which has been shown to successfully jailbreak multiple open-source LLMs. Drawing inspiration from the difficulties of discrete token optimization, our method relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization process while gradually increasing the sparsity of the optimizing vectors. This technique effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art token-level methods. On Harmbench, our approach achieves the highest attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs compared to the latest jailbreak methods. Trigger Warning: This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature.</p></details> |  |
| **[AiRacleX: Automated Detection of Price Oracle Manipulations via LLM-Driven Knowledge Mining and Prompt Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06348v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications depend on accurate price oracles to ensure secure transactions, yet these oracles are highly vulnerable to manipulation, enabling attackers to exploit smart contract vulnerabilities for unfair asset valuation and financial gain. Detecting such manipulations traditionally relies on the manual effort of experienced experts, presenting significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-driven framework that automates the detection of price oracle manipulations by leveraging the complementary strengths of different LLM models (LLMs). Our approach begins with domain-specific knowledge extraction, where an LLM model synthesizes precise insights about price oracle vulnerabilities from top-tier academic papers, eliminating the need for profound expertise from developers or auditors. This knowledge forms the foundation for a second LLM model to generate structured, context-aware chain of thought prompts, which guide a third LLM model in accurately identifying manipulation patterns in smart contracts. We validate the effectiveness of framework through experiments on 60 known vulnerabilities from 46 real-world DeFi attacks or projects spanning 2021 to 2023. The best performing combination of LLMs (Haiku-Haiku-4o-mini) identified by AiRacleX demonstrate a 2.58-times improvement in recall (0.667 vs 0.259) compared to the state-of-the-art tool GPTScan, while maintaining comparable precision. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of replacing commercial models with open-source alternatives, enhancing privacy and security for developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUNAR: LLM Unlearning via Neural Activation Redirection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07218v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from training on ever larger amounts of textual data, but as a result, they increasingly incur the risk of leaking private information. The ability to selectively remove knowledge from LLMs is, therefore, a highly desirable capability. In this paper, we propose LUNAR, a novel unlearning methodology grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis. LUNAR operates by redirecting the representations of unlearned data to regions that trigger the model's inherent ability to express its inability to answer. LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance while significantly enhancing the controllability of the unlearned model during inference. Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x to 11.7x improvements on combined "unlearning efficacy" and "model utility" score ("Deviation Score") on the PISTOL dataset across various base models. We also demonstrate, through quantitative analysis and qualitative examples, LUNAR's superior controllability in generating coherent and contextually aware responses, mitigating undesired side effects of existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust against white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in handling real-world scenarios, such as processing sequential unlearning requests.</p></details> |  |

To address this concern, we present LLM Honeypot, a system designed to monitor autonomous AI hacking agents. By augmenting a standard SSH honeypot with prompt injection and time-based analysis techniques, our framework aims to distinguish LLM agents among all attackers. Over a trial deployment of about three months in a public environment, we collected 8,130,731 hacking attempts and 8 potential AI agents. Our work demonstrates the emergence of AI-driven threats and their current level of usage, serving as an early warning of malicious LLM agents in the wild.</p></details> |  |

Written in SuperCollider, its input parameters enable real-time control of the insect call phase, loudness, and perceived musical pitch. To this end, the anatomical mechanics of the tymbal muscles, tymbal apodeme, tymbal ribs, tymbal plate, abdominal air sac, tympana, and opercula are physically modeled. This also includes decoherence, following the hypothesis that it, in H. maculaticollis, might explain the change in timbre apparent during the final phase of a call sequence. Overall, the algorithm seems to illustrate three main points regarding the trade-offs encountered when modeling bioacoustics for tonal use: that it may be necessary to prioritize musical requirements over realistic physical modeling at many stages of design and implementation; that the resulting adjustments may revolve around having physical modeling perceptually yield sonic events that are well-pitched, single-attack, single-source, and timbrally expressive; that the pitch-adjusted simulation of resonating bodies may fail musically precisely when it succeeds physically, by inducing the perception of different sound sources for different pitches. Audio examples are included, and the source code is structured and documented so as to support the further development of cicada bioacoustics for musical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2024 International Sound and Music Computing Conference</p></details> |

However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While numerous evaluation methods exist, many require computationally expensive processes, such as training multiple shadow models. This article presents two new complementary approaches for efficiently identifying vulnerable tree-based models: an ante-hoc analysis of hyperparameter choices and a post-hoc examination of trained model structure. While these new methods cannot certify whether a model is safe from MIA, they provide practitioners with a means to significantly reduce the number of models that need to undergo expensive MIA assessment through a hierarchical filtering approach. More specifically, it is shown that the rank order of disclosure risk for different hyperparameter combinations remains consistent across datasets, enabling the development of simple, human-interpretable rules for identifying relatively high-risk models before training. While this ante-hoc analysis cannot determine absolute safety since this also depends on the specific dataset, it allows the elimination of unnecessarily risky configurations during hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, computationally inexpensive structural metrics serve as indicators of MIA vulnerability, providing a second filtering stage to identify risky models after training but before conducting expensive attacks. Empirical results show that hyperparameter-based risk prediction rules can achieve high accuracy in predicting the most at risk combinations of hyperparameters across different tree-based model types, while requiring no model training. Moreover, target model accuracy is not seen to correlate with privacy risk, suggesting opportunities to optimise model configurations for both performance and privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[APT-LLM: Embedding-Based Anomaly Detection of Cyber Advanced Persistent Threats Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09385v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth and ability to mimic normal system behavior, making detection particularly difficult in highly imbalanced datasets. Traditional anomaly detection methods struggle to effectively differentiate APT-related activities from benign processes, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces APT-LLM, a novel embedding-based anomaly detection framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) -- BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa -- with autoencoder architectures to detect APTs. Unlike prior approaches, which rely on manually engineered features or conventional anomaly detection models, APT-LLM leverages LLMs to encode process-action provenance traces into semantically rich embeddings, capturing nuanced behavioral patterns. These embeddings are analyzed using three autoencoder architectures -- Baseline Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) -- to model normal process behavior and identify anomalies. The best-performing model is selected for comparison against traditional methods. The framework is evaluated on real-world, highly imbalanced provenance trace datasets from the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data across multiple operating systems (Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows) and attack scenarios. Results demonstrate that APT-LLM significantly improves detection performance under extreme imbalance conditions, outperforming existing anomaly detection methods and highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based feature extraction in cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |

This distributed learning is particularly appealing in scenarios where data privacy is crucial, and it has garnered substantial attention from both industry and academia. However, studies have revealed privacy vulnerabilities in FL, where adversaries can potentially infer sensitive information from the shared model parameters. In this paper, we present an efficient masking-based secure aggregation scheme utilizing lightweight cryptographic primitives to mitigate privacy risks. Our scheme offers several advantages over existing methods. First, it requires only a single setup phase for the entire FL training session, significantly reducing communication overhead. Second, it minimizes user-side overhead by eliminating the need for user-to-user interactions, utilizing an intermediate server layer and a lightweight key negotiation method. Third, the scheme is highly resilient to user dropouts, and the users can join at any FL round. Fourth, it can detect and defend against malicious server activities, including recently discovered model inconsistency attacks. Finally, our scheme ensures security in both semi-honest and malicious settings. We provide security analysis to formally prove the robustness of our approach. Furthermore, we implemented an end-to-end prototype of our scheme. We conducted comprehensive experiments and comparisons, which show that it outperforms existing solutions in terms of communication and computation overhead, functionality, and security.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 Figures |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</p></details> |  |

However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90%+ of the output length limit) in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources.

Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in Customized Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02416v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to a new research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts, i.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs) play an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns about the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these services and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt memorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the scaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence prompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types of prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their prompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of LLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token translation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we investigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find that current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly vulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward user attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the inspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\% and 71.0\% drop in the prompt extraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

| **[Compromising Honesty and Harmlessness in Language Models via Deception Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08301v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated their ability to understand and employ deceptive behavior, even without explicit prompting. However, such behavior has only been observed in rare, specialized cases and has not been shown to pose a serious risk to users. Additionally, research on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models to refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally became honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce a novel attack that undermines both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have serious real-world consequences. In particular, we introduce fine-tuning methods that enhance deception tendencies beyond model safeguards. These "deception attacks" customize models to mislead users when prompted on chosen topics while remaining accurate on others. Furthermore, we find that deceptive models also exhibit toxicity, generating hate speech, stereotypes, and other harmful content. Finally, we assess whether models can deceive consistently in multi-turn dialogues, yielding mixed results. Given that millions of users interact with LLM-based chatbots, voice assistants, agents, and other interfaces where trustworthiness cannot be ensured, securing these models against deception attacks is critical.</p></details> |  |

Written in SuperCollider, its input parameters enable real-time control of the insect call phase, loudness, and perceived musical pitch. To this end, the anatomical mechanics of the tymbal muscles, tymbal apodeme, tymbal ribs, tymbal plate, abdominal air sac, tympana, and opercula are physically modeled. This also includes decoherence, following the hypothesis that it, in H. maculaticollis, might explain the change in timbre apparent during the final phase of a call sequence. Overall, the algorithm seems to illustrate three main points regarding the trade-offs encountered when modeling bioacoustics for tonal use: that it may be necessary to prioritize musical requirements over realistic physical modeling at many stages of design and implementation; that the resulting adjustments may revolve around having physical modeling perceptually yield sonic events that are well-pitched, single-attack, single-source, and timbrally expressive; that the pitch-adjusted simulation of resonating bodies may fail musically precisely when it succeeds physically, by inducing the perception of different sound sources for different pitches. Audio examples are included, and the source code is structured and documented so as to support the further development of cicada bioacoustics for musical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2024 International Sound and Music Computing Conference</p></details> |

However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[A hierarchical approach for assessing the vulnerability of tree-based classification models to membership inference attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09396v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models can inadvertently expose confidential properties of their training data, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA). While numerous evaluation methods exist, many require computationally expensive processes, such as training multiple shadow models. This article presents two new complementary approaches for efficiently identifying vulnerable tree-based models: an ante-hoc analysis of hyperparameter choices and a post-hoc examination of trained model structure. While these new methods cannot certify whether a model is safe from MIA, they provide practitioners with a means to significantly reduce the number of models that need to undergo expensive MIA assessment through a hierarchical filtering approach. More specifically, it is shown that the rank order of disclosure risk for different hyperparameter combinations remains consistent across datasets, enabling the development of simple, human-interpretable rules for identifying relatively high-risk models before training. While this ante-hoc analysis cannot determine absolute safety since this also depends on the specific dataset, it allows the elimination of unnecessarily risky configurations during hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, computationally inexpensive structural metrics serve as indicators of MIA vulnerability, providing a second filtering stage to identify risky models after training but before conducting expensive attacks. Empirical results show that hyperparameter-based risk prediction rules can achieve high accuracy in predicting the most at risk combinations of hyperparameters across different tree-based model types, while requiring no model training. Moreover, target model accuracy is not seen to correlate with privacy risk, suggesting opportunities to optimise model configurations for both performance and privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[APT-LLM: Embedding-Based Anomaly Detection of Cyber Advanced Persistent Threats Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09385v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth and ability to mimic normal system behavior, making detection particularly difficult in highly imbalanced datasets. Traditional anomaly detection methods struggle to effectively differentiate APT-related activities from benign processes, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces APT-LLM, a novel embedding-based anomaly detection framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) -- BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa -- with autoencoder architectures to detect APTs. Unlike prior approaches, which rely on manually engineered features or conventional anomaly detection models, APT-LLM leverages LLMs to encode process-action provenance traces into semantically rich embeddings, capturing nuanced behavioral patterns. These embeddings are analyzed using three autoencoder architectures -- Baseline Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) -- to model normal process behavior and identify anomalies. The best-performing model is selected for comparison against traditional methods. The framework is evaluated on real-world, highly imbalanced provenance trace datasets from the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data across multiple operating systems (Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows) and attack scenarios. Results demonstrate that APT-LLM significantly improves detection performance under extreme imbalance conditions, outperforming existing anomaly detection methods and highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based feature extraction in cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |
