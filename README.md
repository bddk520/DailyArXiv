| **[Publish to Perish: Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM-Assisted Peer Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20863v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into the scientific peer-review process, raising new questions about their reliability and resilience to manipulation. In this work, we investigate the potential for hidden prompt injection attacks, where authors embed adversarial text within a paper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising three distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations -- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design adversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an LLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with domain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit peer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial prompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial LLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show that adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that adversely affect a "honest-but-lazy" reviewer. Finally, we propose and empirically assess methods to reduce detectability of adversarial prompts under automated content checks.</p></details> |  |

It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-driven Provenance Forensics for Threat Investigation and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21323v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PROVSEEK, an LLM-powered agentic framework for automated provenance-driven forensic analysis and threat intelligence extraction. PROVSEEK employs specialized toolchains to dynamically retrieve relevant context by generating precise, context-aware queries that fuse a vectorized threat report knowledge base with data from system provenance databases. The framework resolves provenance queries, orchestrates multiple role-specific agents to mitigate hallucinations, and synthesizes structured, ground-truth verifiable forensic summaries. By combining agent orchestration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, PROVSEEK enables adaptive multi-step analysis that iteratively refines hypotheses, verifies supporting evidence, and produces scalable, interpretable forensic explanations of attack behaviors. By combining provenance data with agentic reasoning, PROVSEEK establishes a new paradigm for grounded agentic forecics to investigate APTs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on publicly available DARPA datasets, demonstrating that PROVSEEK outperforms retrieval-based methods for intelligence extraction task, achieving a 34% improvement in contextual precision/recall; and for threat detection task, PROVSEEK achieves 22%/29% higher precision/recall compared to both a baseline agentic AI approach and State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Provenance-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS).</p></details> |  |
| **[Token Buncher: Shielding LLMs from Harmful Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20697v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Hompage: https://tokenbuncher.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CyberSleuth: Autonomous Blue-Team LLM Agent for Web Attack Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20643v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powerful tools for automating complex tasks. In cybersecurity, researchers have primarily explored their use in red-team operations such as vulnerability discovery and penetration tests. Defensive uses for incident response and forensics have received comparatively less attention and remain at an early stage. This work presents a systematic study of LLM-agent design for the forensic investigation of realistic web application attacks. We propose CyberSleuth, an autonomous agent that processes packet-level traces and application logs to identify the targeted service, the exploited vulnerability (CVE), and attack success. We evaluate the consequences of core design decisions - spanning tool integration and agent architecture - and provide interpretable guidance for practitioners. We benchmark four agent architectures and six LLM backends on 20 incident scenarios of increasing complexity, identifying CyberSleuth as the best-performing design. In a separate set of 10 incidents from 2025, CyberSleuth correctly identifies the exact CVE in 80% of cases. At last, we conduct a human study with 22 experts, which rated the reports of CyberSleuth as complete, useful, and coherent. They also expressed a slight preference for DeepSeek R1, a good news for open source LLM. To foster progress in defensive LLM research, we release both our benchmark and the CyberSleuth platform as a foundation for fair, reproducible evaluation of forensic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SmartData-Polito/LLM_Agent_Cybersecurity_Forensic</p></details> |
| **[Ransomware 3.0: Self-Composing and LLM-Orchestrated](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20444v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using automated reasoning, code synthesis, and contextual decision-making, we introduce a new threat that exploits large language models (LLMs) to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle. Ransomware 3.0 represents the first threat model and research prototype of LLM-orchestrated ransomware. Unlike conventional malware, the prototype only requires natural language prompts embedded in the binary; malicious code is synthesized dynamically by the LLM at runtime, yielding polymorphic variants that adapt to the execution environment. The system performs reconnaissance, payload generation, and personalized extortion, in a closed-loop attack campaign without human involvement. We evaluate this threat across personal, enterprise, and embedded environments using a phase-centric methodology that measures quantitative fidelity and qualitative coherence in each attack phase. We show that open source LLMs can generate functional ransomware components and sustain closed-loop execution across diverse environments. Finally, we present behavioral signals and multi-level telemetry of Ransomware 3.0 through a case study to motivate future development of better defenses and policy enforcements to address novel AI-enabled ransomware attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forewarned is Forearmed: Pre-Synthesizing Jailbreak-like Instructions to Enhance LLM Safety Guardrail to Potential Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20038v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in improving large language model (LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 findings |
| **[Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of 23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries. Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Secure Multi-LLM Agentic AI and Agentification for Edge General Intelligence by Zero-Trust: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19870v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentification serves as a critical enabler of Edge General Intelligence (EGI), transforming massive edge devices into cognitive agents through integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and perception, reasoning, and acting modules. These agents collaborate across heterogeneous edge infrastructures, forming multi-LLM agentic AI systems that leverage collective intelligence and specialized capabilities to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. However, the collaborative nature of multi-LLM systems introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including insecure inter-LLM communications, expanded attack surfaces, and cross-domain data leakage that traditional perimeter-based security cannot adequately address. To this end, this survey introduces zero-trust security of multi-LLM in EGI, a paradigmatic shift following the ``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing the security risks in multi-LLM systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we present the vision of a zero-trust multi-LLM framework in EGI. We then survey key technical progress to facilitate zero-trust multi-LLM systems in EGI. Particularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and system-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification, context-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based management, etc., respectively. Finally, we identify critical research directions. This survey serves as the first systematic treatment of zero-trust applied to multi-LLM systems, providing both theoretical foundations and practical strategies.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Although these models are kept secret, a malicious party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised, making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field. This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks. Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing attacks.</p></details> | Under review |

Text-based phishing dominates for its low cost, scalability, and concealability, advantages recently amplified by large language models (LLMs) that enable ``Phishing-as-a-Service'' attacks at scale within minutes. Despite the growing research into LLM-facilitated phishing attacks, consolidated systematic research on the phishing attack life cycle remains scarce. In this work, we present the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) on LLM-generated phishing, offering an end-to-end analysis that spans generation techniques, attack features, and mitigation strategies. We introduce Generation-Characterization-Defense (GenCharDef), which systematizes the ways in which LLM-generated phishing differs from traditional phishing across methodologies, security perspectives, data dependencies, and evaluation practices. This framework highlights unique challenges of LLM-driven phishing, providing a coherent foundation for understanding the evolving threat landscape and guiding the design of more resilient defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Existing techniques rely on heuristic approaches and lack formal guarantees of undetectability, making them vulnerable to steganographic attacks that can expose or erase the watermark. Additionally, these techniques often degrade output quality by introducing perceptible changes, which is not only undesirable but an important barrier to adoption in practice. In this work, we introduce CLUE-Mark, the first provably undetectable watermarking scheme for diffusion models. CLUE-Mark requires no changes to the model being watermarked, is computationally efficient, and because it is provably undetectable is guaranteed to have no impact on model output quality. Our approach leverages the Continuous Learning With Errors (CLWE) problem -- a cryptographically hard lattice problem -- to embed watermarks in the latent noise vectors used by diffusion models. By proving undetectability via reduction from a cryptographically hard problem we ensure not only that the watermark is imperceptible to human observers or adhoc heuristics, but to \emph{any} efficient detector that does not have the secret key. CLUE-Mark allows multiple keys to be embedded, enabling traceability of images to specific users without altering model parameters. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art diffusion models confirm that CLUE-Mark achieves high recoverability, preserves image quality, and is robust to minor perturbations such JPEG compression and brightness adjustments. Uniquely, CLUE-Mark cannot be detected nor removed by recent steganographic attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Robustness of Autoregressive Language Models against Orthographic Attacks via Pixel-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21206v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2 benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its effectiveness in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lethe: Purifying Backdoored Large Language Models with Knowledge Dilution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21004v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

On the one hand, they have improved the quality of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.</p></details> |  |

Although these models are kept secret, a malicious party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised, making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field. This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks. Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing attacks.</p></details> | Under review |

Text-based phishing dominates for its low cost, scalability, and concealability, advantages recently amplified by large language models (LLMs) that enable ``Phishing-as-a-Service'' attacks at scale within minutes. Despite the growing research into LLM-facilitated phishing attacks, consolidated systematic research on the phishing attack life cycle remains scarce. In this work, we present the first systematization of knowledge (SoK) on LLM-generated phishing, offering an end-to-end analysis that spans generation techniques, attack features, and mitigation strategies. We introduce Generation-Characterization-Defense (GenCharDef), which systematizes the ways in which LLM-generated phishing differs from traditional phishing across methodologies, security perspectives, data dependencies, and evaluation practices. This framework highlights unique challenges of LLM-driven phishing, providing a coherent foundation for understanding the evolving threat landscape and guiding the design of more resilient defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
