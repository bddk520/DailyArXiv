| **[Let the Bees Find the Weak Spots: A Path Planning Perspective on Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks against LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03271v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's robustness. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Shukti042/AdversarialExample.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2025 (camera-ready)</p></details> |
| **[Do Methods to Jailbreak and Defend LLMs Generalize Across Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00689v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment after training and tuning, yet recent work shows that safety can be bypassed through jailbreak attacks. While many jailbreaks and defenses exist, their cross-lingual generalization remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic multilingual evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages -- spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource languages -- using six LLMs on HarmBench and AdvBench. We assess two jailbreak types: logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based. For both types, attack success and defense robustness vary across languages: high-resource languages are safer under standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones. Simple defenses can be effective, but are language- and model-dependent. These findings call for language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On The Dangers of Poisoned LLMs In Security Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02600v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates some of the risks introduced by "LLM poisoning," the intentional or unintentional introduction of malicious or biased data during model training. We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a limited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple LLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes the introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we demonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently dismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we propose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness, robustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v5)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation to system-level compromises. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs security used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving computer takeovers. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection, and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealthy and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed that LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor attacks will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. We found that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks, and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Automated Framework for Strategy Discovery, Retrieval, and Evolution in LLM Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02356v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting, and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scam Shield: Multi-Model Voting and Fine-Tuned LLMs Against Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01746v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scam detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity as adversaries craft messages that evade automated filters. We propose a Hierarchical Scam Detection System (HSDS) that combines a lightweight multi-model voting front end with a fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct back end to improve accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. An ensemble of four classifiers provides preliminary predictions through majority vote, and ambiguous cases are escalated to the fine-tuned model, which is optimized with adversarial training to reduce misclassification. Experiments show that this hierarchical design both improves adversarial scam detection and shortens inference time by routing most cases away from the LLM, outperforming traditional machine-learning baselines and proprietary LLM baselines. The findings highlight the effectiveness of a hybrid voting mechanism and adversarial fine-tuning in fortifying LLMs against evolving scam tactics, enhancing the resilience of automated scam detection systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Align to Misalign: Automatic LLM Jailbreak with Meta-Optimized LLM Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01375v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their safety by addressing inherent weaknesses. Jailbreaks, in which adversaries bypass safeguards with crafted input prompts, play a central role in red-teaming by probing LLMs to elicit unintended or unsafe behaviors. Recent optimization-based jailbreak approaches iteratively refine attack prompts by leveraging LLMs. However, they often rely heavily on either binary attack success rate (ASR) signals, which are sparse, or manually crafted scoring templates, which introduce human bias and uncertainty in the scoring outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce AMIS (Align to MISalign), a meta-optimization framework that jointly evolves jailbreak prompts and scoring templates through a bi-level structure. In the inner loop, prompts are refined using fine-grained and dense feedback using a fixed scoring template. In the outer loop, the template is optimized using an ASR alignment score, gradually evolving to better reflect true attack outcomes across queries. This co-optimization process yields progressively stronger jailbreak prompts and more calibrated scoring signals. Evaluations on AdvBench and JBB-Behaviors demonstrate that AMIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 88.0% ASR on Claude-3.5-Haiku and 100.0% ASR on Claude-4-Sonnet, outperforming existing baselines by substantial margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, 28 pages</p></details> |
| **[DITTO: A Spoofing Attack Framework on Watermarked LLMs via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10987v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation, to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning, from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from expertly imitated ones.

| **[ShadowLogic: Backdoors in Any Whitebox LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00664v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed across various applications, often with safeguards to prevent the generation of harmful or restricted content. However, these safeguards can be covertly bypassed through adversarial modifications to the computational graph of a model. This work highlights a critical security vulnerability in computational graph-based LLM formats, demonstrating that widely used deployment pipelines may be susceptible to obscured backdoors. We introduce ShadowLogic, a method for creating a backdoor in a white-box LLM by injecting an uncensoring vector into its computational graph representation. We set a trigger phrase that, when added to the beginning of a prompt into the LLM, applies the uncensoring vector and removes the content generation safeguards in the model. We embed trigger logic directly into the computational graph which detects the trigger phrase in a prompt. To evade detection of our backdoor, we obfuscate this logic within the graph structure, making it similar to standard model functions. Our method requires minimal alterations to model parameters, making backdoored models appear benign while retaining the ability to generate uncensored responses when activated. We successfully implement ShadowLogic in Phi-3 and Llama 3.2, using ONNX for manipulating computational graphs. Implanting the uncensoring vector achieved a >60% attack success rate for further malicious queries.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like "money laundering" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Manipulation Facing Threats: Evaluating Physical Vulnerabilities in End-to-End Vision Language Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13174v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel framework of MOR via Lie groups, called MORLie, in which high-dimensional dynamical systems on manifolds are approximated by low-dimensional dynamical systems on Lie groups. In comparison to other Lie group methods we are able to attack non-equivariant dynamics, which are frequent in practical applications, and we provide new non-intrusive MOR methods based on the presented geometric formulation. We also highlight numerically that MORLie has a lower error bound than the Kolmogorov $N$-width, which limits linear-subspace methods. The method is applied to various examples: 1. MOR of a simplified deforming body modeled by a noisy point cloud data following a sheering motion, where MORLie outperforms a naive POD approach in terms of accuracy and dimensionality reduction. 2. Reconstructing liver motion during respiration with data from edge detection in ultrasound scans, where MORLie reaches performance approaching the state of the art, while reducing the training time from hours on a computing cluster to minutes on a mobile workstation. 3. An analytic example showing that the method of freezing is analytically recovered as a special case, showing the generality of the geometric framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 21 figures |

In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026 Workshop on Trust and Control in Agentic AI (TrustAgent)</p></details> |

Using automated adversarial testing, we measured each model's resilience against single-turn and multi-turn prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Our findings reveal pervasive vulnerabilities across all tested models, with multi-turn attacks achieving success rates between 25.86\% and 92.78\% -- representing a $2\times$ to $10\times$ increase over single-turn baselines. These results underscore a systemic inability of current open-weight models to maintain safety guardrails across extended interactions. We assess that alignment strategies and lab priorities significantly influence resilience: capability-focused models such as Llama 3.3 and Qwen 3 demonstrate higher multi-turn susceptibility, whereas safety-oriented designs such as Google Gemma 3 exhibit more balanced performance. The analysis concludes that open-weight models, while crucial for innovation, pose tangible operational and ethical risks when deployed without layered security controls. These findings are intended to inform practitioners and developers of the potential risks and the value of professional AI security solutions to mitigate exposure. Addressing multi-turn vulnerabilities is essential to ensure the safe, reliable, and responsible deployment of open-weight LLMs in enterprise and public domains. We recommend adopting a security-first design philosophy and layered protections to ensure resilient deployments of open-weight models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the first systematic study of the Bayesian advantage in re-identifying a user's message under the shuffle model. We begin with a basic setting: one sample is drawn from a distribution $P$, and $n - 1$ samples are drawn from a distribution $Q$, after which all $n$ samples are randomly shuffled. We define $\beta_n(P, Q)$ as the success probability of a Bayes-optimal adversary in identifying the sample from $P$, and define the additive and multiplicative Bayesian advantages as $\mathsf{Adv}_n^{+}(P, Q) = \beta_n(P,Q) - \frac{1}{n}$ and $\mathsf{Adv}_n^{\times}(P, Q) = n \cdot \beta_n(P,Q)$, respectively. We derive exact analytical expressions and asymptotic characterizations of $\beta_n(P, Q)$, along with evaluations in several representative scenarios. Furthermore, we establish (nearly) tight mutual bounds between the additive Bayesian advantage and the total variation distance. Finally, we extend our analysis beyond the basic setting and present, for the first time, an upper bound on the success probability of Bayesian attacks in shuffle differential privacy. Specifically, when the outputs of $n$ users -- each processed through an $\varepsilon$-differentially private local randomizer -- are shuffled, the probability that an attacker successfully re-identifies any target user's message is at most $e^{\varepsilon}/n$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CSF 2026 -- 39th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium</p></details> |

However, their computational intensity restricts deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.</p></details> |  |

| **[Whisper Leak: a side-channel attack on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03675v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like "money laundering" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel framework of MOR via Lie groups, called MORLie, in which high-dimensional dynamical systems on manifolds are approximated by low-dimensional dynamical systems on Lie groups. In comparison to other Lie group methods we are able to attack non-equivariant dynamics, which are frequent in practical applications, and we provide new non-intrusive MOR methods based on the presented geometric formulation. We also highlight numerically that MORLie has a lower error bound than the Kolmogorov $N$-width, which limits linear-subspace methods. The method is applied to various examples: 1. MOR of a simplified deforming body modeled by a noisy point cloud data following a sheering motion, where MORLie outperforms a naive POD approach in terms of accuracy and dimensionality reduction. 2. Reconstructing liver motion during respiration with data from edge detection in ultrasound scans, where MORLie reaches performance approaching the state of the art, while reducing the training time from hours on a computing cluster to minutes on a mobile workstation. 3. An analytic example showing that the method of freezing is analytically recovered as a special case, showing the generality of the geometric framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 21 figures |

In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026 Workshop on Trust and Control in Agentic AI (TrustAgent)</p></details> |
