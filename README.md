Most existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore, we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods shows its strong generalization capability.

| **[HarmMetric Eval: Benchmarking Metrics and Judges for LLM Harmfulness Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24384v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval, and the code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HarmMetric-Eval-4CBE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p></details> |  |

We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families. Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates (ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction. Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formalization Driven LLM Prompt Jailbreaking via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23558v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework (\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and \underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions, which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses. The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.</p></details> |  |

Despite these potential benefits, the integrated XR-LLM pipeline makes XR applications vulnerable to new forms of attacks. In this paper, we analyze LLM-Integated XR systems in the literature and in practice and categorize them along different dimensions from a systems perspective. Building on this categorization, we identify a common threat model and demonstrate a series of proof-of-concept attacks on multiple XR platforms that employ various LLM models (Meta Quest 3, Meta Ray-Ban, Android, and Microsoft HoloLens 2 running Llama and GPT models). Although these platforms each implement LLM integration differently, they share vulnerabilities where an attacker can modify the public context surrounding a legitimate LLM query, resulting in erroneous visual or auditory feedback to users, thus compromising their safety or privacy, sowing confusion, or other harmful effects. To defend against these threats, we discuss mitigation strategies and best practices for developers, including an initial defense prototype, and call on the community to develop new protection mechanisms to mitigate these risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[NanoFlux: Adversarial Dual-LLM Evaluation and Distillation For Multi-Domain Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23252v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[Virus Infection Attack on LLMs: Your Poisoning Can Spread "VIA" Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23041v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development, potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely, Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight.

While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we reveal a new side-channel whereby input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect speculations can be inferred by monitoring per-iteration token counts or packet sizes.We demonstrate that an adversary observing these patterns can fingerprint user queries with >90% accuracy across four speculative-decoding schemes, REST (100\%), LADE (up to 92%), BiLD (up to 95%), and EAGLE (up to 77.6%) and leak confidential datastore contents used for prediction at rates exceeding 25 tokens/sec. We evaluate the side-channel attacks in both research prototypes as well as the production-grade vLLM serving framework. To defend against these, we propose and evaluate a suite of mitigations, including packet padding and iteration-wise token aggregation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Language Models Optimized to Fool Detectors Still Have a Distinct Style (And How to Change It)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14608v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors, it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space -- the stylistic feature space -- that is robust to such optimization, and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions become distinguishable. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to avoid reliance on machine-text detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Membership Inference on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25003v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples, such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters ($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion process</p></details> |  |
| **[PRIVMARK: Private Large Language Models Watermarking with MPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24624v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has highlighted the pressing need for reliable mechanisms to verify content ownership and ensure traceability. Watermarking offers a promising path forward, but it remains limited by privacy concerns in sensitive scenarios, as traditional approaches often require direct access to a model's parameters or its training data. In this work, we propose a secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based private LLMs watermarking framework, PRIVMARK, to address the concerns. Concretely, we investigate PostMark (EMNLP'2024), one of the state-of-the-art LLMs Watermarking methods, and formulate its basic operations. Then, we construct efficient protocols for these operations using the MPC primitives in a black-box manner. In this way, PRIVMARK enables multiple parties to collaboratively watermark an LLM's output without exposing the model's weights to any single computing party. We implement PRIVMARK using SecretFlow-SPU (USENIX ATC'2023) and evaluate its performance using the ABY3 (CCS'2018) backend. The experimental results show that PRIVMARK achieves semantically identical results compared to the plaintext baseline without MPC and is resistant against paraphrasing and removing attacks with reasonable efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under peer-review</p></details> |
| **[TrojanStego: Your Language Model Can Secretly Be A Steganographic Privacy Leaking Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20118v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into sensitive workflows, concerns grow over their potential to leak confidential information. We propose TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over 97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures To be presented in the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2025</p></details> |
| **[TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However, the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones, making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Generalizability and Undetectability for Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Pre-trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19994v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs) exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffuGuard: How Intrinsic Safety is Lost and Found in Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24296v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias, while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/niez233/DiffuGuard.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdvChain: Adversarial Chain-of-Thought Tuning for Robust Safety Alignment of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24269v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[BitHydra: Towards Bit-flip Inference Cost Attack against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16670v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed, but their growing compute demands expose them to inference cost attacks that maximize output length. We reveal that prior attacks are fundamentally self-targeting because they rely on crafted inputs, so the added cost accrues to the attacker's own queries and scales poorly in practice. In this work, we introduce the first bit-flip inference cost attack that directly modifies model weights to induce persistent overhead for all users of a compromised LLM. Such attacks are stealthy yet realistic in practice: for instance, in shared MLaaS environments, co-located tenants can exploit hardware-level faults (e.g., Rowhammer) to flip memory bits storing model parameters. We instantiate this attack paradigm with BitHydra, which (1) minimizes a loss that suppresses the end-of-sequence token (i.e., EOS) and (2) employs an efficient yet effective critical-bit search focused on the EOS embedding vector, sharply reducing the search space while preserving benign-looking outputs. We evaluate across 11 LLMs (1.5B-14B) under int8 and float16, demonstrating that our method efficiently achieves scalable cost inflation with only a few bit flips, while remaining effective even against potential defenses.</p></details> |  |

We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space -- the stylistic feature space -- that is robust to such optimization, and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions become distinguishable. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to avoid reliance on machine-text detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Membership Inference on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25003v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples, such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters ($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion process</p></details> |  |
| **[PRIVMARK: Private Large Language Models Watermarking with MPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24624v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has highlighted the pressing need for reliable mechanisms to verify content ownership and ensure traceability. Watermarking offers a promising path forward, but it remains limited by privacy concerns in sensitive scenarios, as traditional approaches often require direct access to a model's parameters or its training data. In this work, we propose a secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based private LLMs watermarking framework, PRIVMARK, to address the concerns. Concretely, we investigate PostMark (EMNLP'2024), one of the state-of-the-art LLMs Watermarking methods, and formulate its basic operations. Then, we construct efficient protocols for these operations using the MPC primitives in a black-box manner. In this way, PRIVMARK enables multiple parties to collaboratively watermark an LLM's output without exposing the model's weights to any single computing party. We implement PRIVMARK using SecretFlow-SPU (USENIX ATC'2023) and evaluate its performance using the ABY3 (CCS'2018) backend. The experimental results show that PRIVMARK achieves semantically identical results compared to the plaintext baseline without MPC and is resistant against paraphrasing and removing attacks with reasonable efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under peer-review</p></details> |

We propose TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over 97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures To be presented in the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2025</p></details> |
