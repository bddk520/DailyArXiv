| **[MixAT: Combining Continuous and Discrete Adversarial Training for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16947v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent efforts in Large Language Model (LLM) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs can still consistently force harmful generations. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. At the same time, despite their effectiveness and generalization capabilities, training with continuous perturbations does not always capture the full spectrum of vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Fast-MIA: Efficient and Scalable Membership Inference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23074v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Fast-MIA (https://github.com/Nikkei/fast-mia), a Python library for efficiently evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against Large Language Models (LLMs). MIA against LLMs has emerged as a crucial challenge due to growing concerns over copyright, security, and data privacy, and has attracted increasing research attention. However, the progress of this research is significantly hindered by two main obstacles: (1) the high computational cost of inference in LLMs, and (2) the lack of standardized and maintained implementations of MIA methods, which makes large-scale empirical comparison difficult. To address these challenges, our library provides fast batch inference and includes implementations of representative MIA methods under a unified evaluation framework. This library supports easy implementation of reproducible benchmarks with simple configuration and extensibility. We release Fast-MIA as an open-source (Apache License 2.0) tool to support scalable and transparent research on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompressionAttack: Exploiting Prompt Compression as a New Attack Surface in LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22963v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs, but this introduces a new security risk. Compression modules, which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety, can be manipulated by adversarial inputs, causing semantic drift and altering LLM behavior. This work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents CompressionAttack, the first framework to exploit it. CompressionAttack includes two strategies: HardCom, which uses discrete adversarial edits for hard compression, and SoftCom, which performs latent-space perturbations for soft compression. Experiments on multiple LLMs show up to 80% attack success and 98% preference flips, while remaining highly stealthy and transferable. Case studies in VSCode Cline and Ollama confirm real-world impact, and current defenses prove ineffective, highlighting the need for stronger protections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sentra-Guard: A Multilingual Human-AI Framework for Real-Time Defense Against Adversarial LLM Jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22628v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a real-time modular defense system named Sentra-Guard. The system detects and mitigates jailbreak and prompt injection attacks targeting large language models (LLMs). The framework uses a hybrid architecture with FAISS-indexed SBERT embedding representations that capture the semantic meaning of prompts, combined with fine-tuned transformer classifiers, which are machine learning models specialized for distinguishing between benign and adversarial language inputs. It identifies adversarial prompts in both direct and obfuscated attack vectors. A core innovation is the classifier-retriever fusion module, which dynamically computes context-aware risk scores that estimate how likely a prompt is to be adversarial based on its content and context. The framework ensures multilingual resilience with a language-agnostic preprocessing layer. This component automatically translates non-English prompts into English for semantic evaluation, enabling consistent detection across over 100 languages. The system includes a HITL feedback loop, where decisions made by the automated system are reviewed by human experts for continual learning and rapid adaptation under adversarial pressure. Sentra-Guard maintains an evolving dual-labeled knowledge base of benign and malicious prompts, enhancing detection reliability and reducing false positives. Evaluation results show a 99.96% detection rate (AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00) and an attack success rate (ASR) of only 0.004%. This outperforms leading baselines such as LlamaGuard-2 (1.3%) and OpenAI Moderation (3.7%). Unlike black-box approaches, Sentra-Guard is transparent, fine-tunable, and compatible with diverse LLM backends. Its modular design supports scalable deployment in both commercial and open-source environments. The system establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial LLM defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Breaking Agent Backbones: Evaluating the Security of Backbone LLMs in AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22620v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being deployed at scale, yet we lack a systematic understanding of how the choice of backbone LLM affects agent security. The non-deterministic sequential nature of AI agents complicates security modeling, while the integration of traditional software with AI components entangles novel LLM vulnerabilities with conventional security risks. Existing frameworks only partially address these challenges as they either capture specific vulnerabilities only or require modeling of complete agents. To address these limitations, we introduce threat snapshots: a framework that isolates specific states in an agent's execution flow where LLM vulnerabilities manifest, enabling the systematic identification and categorization of security risks that propagate from the LLM to the agent level. We apply this framework to construct the $\operatorname{b}^3$ benchmark, a security benchmark based on 194331 unique crowdsourced adversarial attacks. We then evaluate 31 popular LLMs with it, revealing, among other insights, that enhanced reasoning capabilities improve security, while model size does not correlate with security. We release our benchmark, dataset, and evaluation code to facilitate widespread adoption by LLM providers and practitioners, offering guidance for agent developers and incentivizing model developers to prioritize backbone security improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Julia...</summary><p>Julia Bazinska and Max Mathys contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[AegisMCP: Online Graph Intrusion Detection for Tool-Augmented LLMs on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19462v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study security of Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent toolchains and their applications in smart homes. We introduce AegisMCP, a protocol-level intrusion detector. Our contributions are: (i) a minimal attack suite spanning instruction-driven escalation, chain-of-tool exfiltration, malicious MCP server registration, and persistence; (ii) NEBULA-Schema (Network-Edge Behavioral Learning for Untrusted LLM Agents), a reusable protocol-level instrumentation that represents MCP activity as a streaming heterogeneous temporal graph over agents, MCP servers, tools, devices, remotes, and sessions; and (iii) a CPU-only streaming detector that fuses novelty, session-DAG structure, and attribute cues for near-real-time edge inference, with optional fusion of local prompt-guardrail signals. On an emulated smart-home testbed spanning multiple MCP stacks and a physical bench, AegisMCP achieves sub-second per-window model inference and end-to-end alerting. The latency of AegisMCP is consistently sub-second on Intel N150-class edge hardware, while outperforming traffic-only and sequence baselines; ablations confirm the importance of DAG and install/permission signals. We release code, schemas, and generators for reproducible evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Injection Attacks on LLM Agents via Query-Only Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering the Persuasive Fingerprint of LLMs in Jailbreaking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21983v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text, may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors. This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[$δ$-STEAL: LLM Stealing Attack with Local Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21946v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their deployment introduces significant risks related to intellectual property. In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks, where adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services. These attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats to revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking solution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model traceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\delta$-STEAL, a novel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark detectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\delta$-STEAL injects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during fine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP) guarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect outputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise to these pairs, $\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it difficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used, thereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that $\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of up to $96.95\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model utility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack effectiveness and model utility. This poses a significant risk, as even robust watermarks can be bypassed, allowing adversaries to deceive watermark detectors and undermine current intellectual property protection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACML 2025 (PMLR W&CP).

| **[Detecting Various DeFi Price Manipulations with LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11521v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is one of the most important applications of today's cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. It manages hundreds of billions in Total Value Locked (TVL) on-chain, yet it remains susceptible to common DeFi price manipulation attacks. Despite state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems like DeFiRanger and DeFort, we found that they are less effective to non-standard price models in custom DeFi protocols, which account for 44.2% of the 95 DeFi price manipulation attacks reported over the past three years. In this paper, we introduce the first LLM-based approach, DeFiScope, for detecting DeFi price manipulation attacks in both standard and custom price models. Our insight is that large language models (LLMs) have certain intelligence to abstract price calculation from smart contract source code and infer the trend of token price changes based on the extracted price models. To further strengthen LLMs in this aspect, we leverage Foundry to synthesize on-chain data and use it to fine-tune a DeFi price-specific LLM. Together with the high-level DeFi operations recovered from low-level transaction data, DeFiScope detects various DeFi price manipulations according to systematically mined patterns. Experimental results show that DeFiScope achieves a high recall of 80% on real-world attacks, a precision of 96% on suspicious transactions, and zero false alarms on benign transactions, significantly outperforming SOTA approaches. Moreover, we evaluate DeFiScope's cost-effectiveness and demonstrate its practicality by helping our industry partner confirm 147 real-world price manipulation attacks, including discovering 81 previously unknown historical incidents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025.

We observe that the ability to recall an object (physical or virtual) that was encountered in a mobile AR experience depends on many possible impact factors and attributes, with some objects being readily recalled while others are not, and some people recalling objects overall much better or worse than others. This opens up a potential cognitive attack in which adversaries might create conditions that make an AR user not recall certain potentially mission-critical objects. We explore whether a calibrated predictor of object recall can help shield against such cognitive attacks. We pool data from four mobile AR studies (with a total of 1,152 object recall probes) and fit a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) with formative Object, Scene, and User State composites predicting recall, also benchmarking against Random Forest and multilayer perceptron classifiers. PLS-SEM attains the best F1 score in three of four studies. Additionally, path estimates identify lighting, augmentation density, AR registration stability, cognitive load, and AR familiarity as primary drivers.

| **[Maximal Load Shedding Verification for Neural Network Models of AC Line Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23806v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving for globally optimal line switching decisions in AC transmission grids can be intractability slow. Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed. Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation, however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved via MathOptAI.jl. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models which contain more than 10 million model parameters.</p></details> |  |

Your Vision Language Model Could Be Maliciously Manipulated](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19911v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> |

This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+ downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation. Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently alter model semantics.

Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80 players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods (erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions.

Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction. We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs.

However, existing risky prompt datasets are limited in three key areas: 1) limited risky categories, 2) coarse-grained annotation, and 3) low effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce T2I-RiskyPrompt, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating safety-related tasks in T2I models. Specifically, we first develop a hierarchical risk taxonomy, which consists of 6 primary categories and 14 fine-grained subcategories. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct a pipeline to collect and annotate risky prompts. Finally, we obtain 6,432 effective risky prompts, where each prompt is annotated with both hierarchical category labels and detailed risk reasons. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation, we propose a reason-driven risky image detection method that explicitly aligns the MLLM with safety annotations. Based on T2I-RiskyPrompt, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight T2I models, nine defense methods, five safety filters, and five attack strategies, offering nine key insights into the strengths and limitations of T2I model safety. Finally, we discuss potential applications of T2I-RiskyPrompt across various research fields.

We observe that the ability to recall an object (physical or virtual) that was encountered in a mobile AR experience depends on many possible impact factors and attributes, with some objects being readily recalled while others are not, and some people recalling objects overall much better or worse than others. This opens up a potential cognitive attack in which adversaries might create conditions that make an AR user not recall certain potentially mission-critical objects. We explore whether a calibrated predictor of object recall can help shield against such cognitive attacks. We pool data from four mobile AR studies (with a total of 1,152 object recall probes) and fit a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) with formative Object, Scene, and User State composites predicting recall, also benchmarking against Random Forest and multilayer perceptron classifiers. PLS-SEM attains the best F1 score in three of four studies. Additionally, path estimates identify lighting, augmentation density, AR registration stability, cognitive load, and AR familiarity as primary drivers. The model outputs per-object recall probabilities that can drive interface adjustments when predicted recall falls. Overall, PLS-SEM provides competitive accuracy with interpretable levers for design and evaluation in mobile AR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference Paper, 5 pages.
