| **[NetEcho: From Real-World Streaming Side-Channels to Full LLM Conversation Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25472v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly expanding landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) applications, real-time output streaming has become the dominant interaction paradigm. While this enhances user experience, recent research reveals that it exposes a non-trivial attack surface through network side-channels. Adversaries can exploit patterns in encrypted traffic to infer sensitive information and reconstruct private conversations. In response, LLM providers and third-party services are deploying defenses such as traffic padding and obfuscation to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This paper starts by presenting a systematic analysis of contemporary side-channel defenses in mainstream LLM applications, with a focus on services from vendors like OpenAI and DeepSeek. We identify and examine seven representative deployment scenarios, each incorporating active/passive mitigation techniques. Despite these enhanced security measures, our investigation uncovers significant residual information that remains vulnerable to leakage within the network traffic. Building on this discovery, we introduce NetEcho, a novel, LLM-based framework that comprehensively unleashes the network side-channel risks of today's LLM applications. NetEcho is designed to recover entire conversations -- including both user prompts and LLM responses -- directly from encrypted network traffic. It features a deliberate design that ensures high-fidelity text recovery, transferability across different deployment scenarios, and moderate operational cost. In our evaluations on medical and legal applications built upon leading models like DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, NetEcho can recover avg $\sim$70\% information of each conversation, demonstrating a critical limitation in current defense mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and proposing future directions for augmenting network traffic security.</p></details> |  |
| **[MixAT: Combining Continuous and Discrete Adversarial Training for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16947v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent efforts in Large Language Model (LLM) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs can still consistently force harmful generations. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. At the same time, despite their effectiveness and generalization capabilities, training with continuous perturbations does not always capture the full spectrum of vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Fast-MIA: Efficient and Scalable Membership Inference for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23074v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Fast-MIA (https://github.com/Nikkei/fast-mia), a Python library for efficiently evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against Large Language Models (LLMs). MIA against LLMs has emerged as a crucial challenge due to growing concerns over copyright, security, and data privacy, and has attracted increasing research attention. However, the progress of this research is significantly hindered by two main obstacles: (1) the high computational cost of inference in LLMs, and (2) the lack of standardized and maintained implementations of MIA methods, which makes large-scale empirical comparison difficult. To address these challenges, our library provides fast batch inference and includes implementations of representative MIA methods under a unified evaluation framework. This library supports easy implementation of reproducible benchmarks with simple configuration and extensibility. We release Fast-MIA as an open-source (Apache License 2.0) tool to support scalable and transparent research on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompressionAttack: Exploiting Prompt Compression as a New Attack Surface in LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22963v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs, but this introduces a new security risk. Compression modules, which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety, can be manipulated by adversarial inputs, causing semantic drift and altering LLM behavior. This work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents CompressionAttack, the first framework to exploit it. CompressionAttack includes two strategies: HardCom, which uses discrete adversarial edits for hard compression, and SoftCom, which performs latent-space perturbations for soft compression. Experiments on multiple LLMs show up to 80% attack success and 98% preference flips, while remaining highly stealthy and transferable. Case studies in VSCode Cline and Ollama confirm real-world impact, and current defenses prove ineffective, highlighting the need for stronger protections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sentra-Guard: A Multilingual Human-AI Framework for Real-Time Defense Against Adversarial LLM Jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22628v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a real-time modular defense system named Sentra-Guard. The system detects and mitigates jailbreak and prompt injection attacks targeting large language models (LLMs). The framework uses a hybrid architecture with FAISS-indexed SBERT embedding representations that capture the semantic meaning of prompts, combined with fine-tuned transformer classifiers, which are machine learning models specialized for distinguishing between benign and adversarial language inputs. It identifies adversarial prompts in both direct and obfuscated attack vectors. A core innovation is the classifier-retriever fusion module, which dynamically computes context-aware risk scores that estimate how likely a prompt is to be adversarial based on its content and context. The framework ensures multilingual resilience with a language-agnostic preprocessing layer. This component automatically translates non-English prompts into English for semantic evaluation, enabling consistent detection across over 100 languages. The system includes a HITL feedback loop, where decisions made by the automated system are reviewed by human experts for continual learning and rapid adaptation under adversarial pressure. Sentra-Guard maintains an evolving dual-labeled knowledge base of benign and malicious prompts, enhancing detection reliability and reducing false positives. Evaluation results show a 99.96% detection rate (AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00) and an attack success rate (ASR) of only 0.004%. This outperforms leading baselines such as LlamaGuard-2 (1.3%) and OpenAI Moderation (3.7%). Unlike black-box approaches, Sentra-Guard is transparent, fine-tunable, and compatible with diverse LLM backends. Its modular design supports scalable deployment in both commercial and open-source environments. The system establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial LLM defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Breaking Agent Backbones: Evaluating the Security of Backbone LLMs in AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22620v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being deployed at scale, yet we lack a systematic understanding of how the choice of backbone LLM affects agent security. The non-deterministic sequential nature of AI agents complicates security modeling, while the integration of traditional software with AI components entangles novel LLM vulnerabilities with conventional security risks. Existing frameworks only partially address these challenges as they either capture specific vulnerabilities only or require modeling of complete agents. To address these limitations, we introduce threat snapshots: a framework that isolates specific states in an agent's execution flow where LLM vulnerabilities manifest, enabling the systematic identification and categorization of security risks that propagate from the LLM to the agent level. We apply this framework to construct the $\operatorname{b}^3$ benchmark, a security benchmark based on 194331 unique crowdsourced adversarial attacks. We then evaluate 31 popular LLMs with it, revealing, among other insights, that enhanced reasoning capabilities improve security, while model size does not correlate with security. We release our benchmark, dataset, and evaluation code to facilitate widespread adoption by LLM providers and practitioners, offering guidance for agent developers and incentivizing model developers to prioritize backbone security improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Julia...</summary><p>Julia Bazinska and Max Mathys contributed equally</p></details> |

We introduce AegisMCP, a protocol-level intrusion detector. Our contributions are: (i) a minimal attack suite spanning instruction-driven escalation, chain-of-tool exfiltration, malicious MCP server registration, and persistence; (ii) NEBULA-Schema (Network-Edge Behavioral Learning for Untrusted LLM Agents), a reusable protocol-level instrumentation that represents MCP activity as a streaming heterogeneous temporal graph over agents, MCP servers, tools, devices, remotes, and sessions; and (iii) a CPU-only streaming detector that fuses novelty, session-DAG structure, and attribute cues for near-real-time edge inference, with optional fusion of local prompt-guardrail signals. On an emulated smart-home testbed spanning multiple MCP stacks and a physical bench, AegisMCP achieves sub-second per-window model inference and end-to-end alerting. The latency of AegisMCP is consistently sub-second on Intel N150-class edge hardware, while outperforming traffic-only and sequence baselines; ablations confirm the importance of DAG and install/permission signals. We release code, schemas, and generators for reproducible evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Injection Attacks on LLM Agents via Query-Only Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering the Persuasive Fingerprint of LLMs in Jailbreaking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21983v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text, may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors. This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[$δ$-STEAL: LLM Stealing Attack with Local Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21946v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their deployment introduces significant risks related to intellectual property. In this context, we focus on model stealing attacks, where adversaries replicate the behaviors of these models to steal services. These attacks are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose serious threats to revenue and financial stability. To mitigate these risks, the watermarking solution embeds imperceptible patterns in LLM outputs, enabling model traceability and intellectual property verification. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of LLM service providers by introducing $\delta$-STEAL, a novel model stealing attack that bypasses the service provider's watermark detectors while preserving the adversary's model utility. $\delta$-STEAL injects noise into the token embeddings of the adversary's model during fine-tuning in a way that satisfies local differential privacy (LDP) guarantees. The adversary queries the service provider's model to collect outputs and form input-output training pairs. By applying LDP-preserving noise to these pairs, $\delta$-STEAL obfuscates watermark signals, making it difficult for the service provider to determine whether its outputs were used, thereby preventing claims of model theft. Our experiments show that $\delta$-STEAL with lightweight modifications achieves attack success rates of up to $96.95\%$ without significantly compromising the adversary's model utility. The noise scale in LDP controls the trade-off between attack effectiveness and model utility. This poses a significant risk, as even robust watermarks can be bypassed, allowing adversaries to deceive watermark detectors and undermine current intellectual property protection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACML 2025 (PMLR W&CP).

| **[Model Inversion Attacks Meet Cryptographic Fuzzy Extractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25687v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model inversion attacks pose an open challenge to privacy-sensitive applications that use machine learning (ML) models. For example, face authentication systems use modern ML models to compute embedding vectors from face images of the enrolled users and store them. If leaked, inversion attacks can accurately reconstruct user faces from the leaked vectors. There is no systematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against model inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face authentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of best-effort solutions. In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong defense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the cryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy extractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication. We do so through a new model inversion attack called PIPE, which achieves a success rate of over 89% in most cases against prior schemes. We then propose L2FE-Hash, the first candidate fuzzy extractor which supports standard Euclidean distance comparators as needed in many ML-based applications, including face authentication. We formally characterize its computational security guarantees, even in the extreme threat model of full breach of stored secrets, and empirically show its usable accuracy in face authentication for practical face distributions. It offers attack-agnostic security without requiring any re-training of the ML model it protects. Empirically, it nullifies both prior state-of-the-art inversion attacks as well as our new PIPE attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Models Outthink Their Safety: Mitigating Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models with Chain-of-Guardrails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21285v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts. This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs. Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

We extend this paradigm to safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF), and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable, and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance.</p></details> |  |

We present OpenGuardrails, the first fully open-source platform that unifies large-model-based safety detection, manipulation defense, and deployable guardrail infrastructure. OpenGuardrails protects against three major classes of risks: (1) content-safety violations such as harmful or explicit text generation, (2) model-manipulation attacks including prompt injection, jailbreaks, and code-interpreter abuse, and (3) data leakage involving sensitive or private information. Unlike prior modular or rule-based frameworks, OpenGuardrails introduces three core innovations: (1) a Configurable Policy Adaptation mechanism that allows per-request customization of unsafe categories and sensitivity thresholds; (2) a Unified LLM-based Guard Architecture that performs both content-safety and manipulation detection within a single model; and (3) a Quantized, Scalable Model Design that compresses a 14B dense base model to 3.3B via GPTQ while preserving over 98 of benchmark accuracy. The system supports 119 languages, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multilingual safety benchmarks, and can be deployed as a secure gateway or API-based service for enterprise use. All models, datasets, and deployment scripts are released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called $\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for adversarial learning of clustering models.</p></details> |  |

However, the application of FaR introduces non-negligible performance and memory overheads, primarily due to the runtime modification of activation pathways and the lack of hardware-level optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose FaRAccel, a novel hardware accelerator architecture implemented on FPGA, specifically designed to offload and optimize FaR operations. FaRAccel integrates reconfigurable logic for dynamic activation rerouting, and lightweight storage of rewiring configurations, enabling low-latency inference with minimal energy overhead. We evaluate FaRAccel across a suite of Transformer models and demonstrate substantial reductions in FaR inference latency and improvement in energy efficiency, while maintaining the robustness gains of the original FaR methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hardware-accelerated defense against BFAs in Transformers, effectively bridging the gap between algorithmic resilience and efficient deployment on real-world AI platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By ICCD 2025</p></details> |

Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed. Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation, however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved via MathOptAI.jl. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models which contain more than 10 million model parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack (VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking, hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> |

| **[Model Inversion Attacks Meet Cryptographic Fuzzy Extractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25687v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model inversion attacks pose an open challenge to privacy-sensitive applications that use machine learning (ML) models. For example, face authentication systems use modern ML models to compute embedding vectors from face images of the enrolled users and store them. If leaked, inversion attacks can accurately reconstruct user faces from the leaked vectors. There is no systematic characterization of properties needed in an ideal defense against model inversion, even for the canonical example application of a face authentication system susceptible to data breaches, despite a decade of best-effort solutions. In this paper, we formalize the desired properties of a provably strong defense against model inversion and connect it, for the first time, to the cryptographic concept of fuzzy extractors. We further show that existing fuzzy extractors are insecure for use in ML-based face authentication. We do so through a new model inversion attack called PIPE, which achieves a success rate of over 89% in most cases against prior schemes. We then propose L2FE-Hash, the first candidate fuzzy extractor which supports standard Euclidean distance comparators as needed in many ML-based applications, including face authentication. We formally characterize its computational security guarantees, even in the extreme threat model of full breach of stored secrets, and empirically show its usable accuracy in face authentication for practical face distributions. It offers attack-agnostic security without requiring any re-training of the ML model it protects. Empirically, it nullifies both prior state-of-the-art inversion attacks as well as our new PIPE attack.</p></details> |  |
