| **[SearchAttack: Red-Teaming LLMs against Knowledge-to-Action Threats under Online Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04093v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, people have suffered from LLM hallucination and have become increasingly aware of the reliability gap of LLMs in open and knowledge-intensive tasks. As a result, they have increasingly turned to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, LLM-driven search also becomes an attractive target for misuse. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful instructions or takeaways for users, it becomes difficult to withdraw or undo such exposure. To investigate LLMs' unsafe search behavior issues, we first propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming, which (1) rephrases harmful semantics via dense and benign knowledge to evade direct in-context decoding, thus eliciting unsafe information retrieval, (2) stress-tests LLMs' reward-chasing bias by steering them to synthesize unsafe retrieved content. We also curate an emergent, domain-specific illicit activity benchmark for search-based threat assessment, and introduce a fact-checking framework to ground and quantify harm in both offline and online attack settings. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems. We also find that LLMs without web search can still be steered into harmful content output due to their information-seeking stereotypical behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Misus...</summary><p>Misusing LLM-driven search for harmful information-seeking poses serious risks.

| **[Sparse Models, Sparse Safety: Unsafe Routes in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08621v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By introducing routers to selectively activate experts in Transformer layers, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture significantly reduces computational costs in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining competitive performance, especially for models with massive parameters. However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs + Security = Trouble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08422v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that when it comes to producing secure code with AI, the prevailing "fighting fire with fire" approach -- using probabilistic AI-based checkers or attackers to secure probabilistically generated code -- fails to address the long tail of security bugs. As a result, systems may remain exposed to zero-day vulnerabilities that can be discovered by better-resourced or more persistent adversaries. While neurosymbolic approaches that combine LLMs with formal methods are attractive in principle, we argue that they are difficult to reconcile with the "vibe coding" workflow common in LLM-assisted development: unless the end-to-end verification pipeline is fully automated, developers are repeatedly asked to validate specifications, resolve ambiguities, and adjudicate failures, making the human-in-the-loop a likely point of weakness, compromising secure-by-construction guarantees. In this paper we argue that stronger security guarantees can be obtained by enforcing security constraints during code generation (e.g., via constrained decoding), rather than relying solely on post-hoc detection and repair. This direction is particularly promising for diffusion-style code models, whose approach provides a natural elegant opportunity for modular, hierarchical security enforcement, allowing us to combine lower-latency generation techniques with generating secure-by-construction code.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Trust-Authorization Mismatch in LLM Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06914v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous agents capable of executing complex workflows via standardized protocols (e.g., MCP). However, this paradigm shifts control from deterministic code to probabilistic inference, creating a fundamental Trust-Authorization Mismatch: static permissions are structurally decoupled from the agent's fluctuating runtime trustworthiness. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we survey more than 200 representative papers to categorize the emerging landscape of agent security. We propose the Belief-Intention-Permission (B-I-P) framework as a unifying formal lens. By decomposing agent execution into three distinct stages-Belief Formation, Intent Generation, and Permission Grant-we demonstrate that diverse threats, from prompt injection to tool poisoning, share a common root cause: the desynchronization between dynamic trust states and static authorization boundaries. Using the B-I-P lens, we systematically map existing attacks and defenses and identify critical gaps where current mechanisms fail to bridge this mismatch. Finally, we outline a research agenda for shifting from static Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to dynamic, risk-adaptive authorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Adaptable Detection of Malicious LLM Prompts via Bootstrap Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08062v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberExplorer: Benchmarking LLM Offensive Security Capabilities in a Real-World Attacking Simulation Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08023v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world offensive security operations are inherently open-ended: attackers explore unknown attack surfaces, revise hypotheses under uncertainty, and operate without guaranteed success. Existing LLM-based offensive agent evaluations rely on closed-world settings with predefined goals and binary success criteria. To address this gap, we introduce CyberExplorer, an evaluation suite with two core components: (1) an open-environment benchmark built on a virtual machine hosting 40 vulnerable web services derived from real-world CTF challenges, where agents autonomously perform reconnaissance, target selection, and exploitation without prior knowledge of vulnerability locations; and (2) a reactive multi-agent framework supporting dynamic exploration without predefined plans. CyberExplorer enables fine-grained evaluation beyond flag recovery, capturing interaction dynamics, coordination behavior, failure modes, and vulnerability discovery signals-bridging the gap between benchmarks and realistic multi-target attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Recurring Vulnerabilities from Black-Box LLM-Generated Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04894v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used for code generation, but their outputs often follow recurring templates that can induce predictable vulnerabilities. We study \emph{vulnerability persistence} in LLM-generated software and introduce \emph{Feature--Security Table (FSTab)} with two components. First, FSTab enables a black-box attack that predicts likely backend vulnerabilities from observable frontend features and knowledge of the source LLM, without access to backend code or source code. Second, FSTab provides a model-centric evaluation that quantifies how consistently a given model reproduces the same vulnerabilities across programs, semantics-preserving rephrasings, and application domains. We evaluate FSTab on state-of-the-art code LLMs, including GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5 Opus, and Gemini-3 Pro, across diverse application domains. Our results show strong cross-domain transfer: even when the target domain is excluded from training, FSTab achieves up to 94\% attack success and 93\% vulnerability coverage on Internal Tools (Claude-4.5 Opus). These findings expose an underexplored attack surface in LLM-generated software and highlight the security risks of code generation. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FSTab-024E.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Rethinking Latency Denial-of-Service: Attacking the LLM Serving Framework, Not the Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07878v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models face an emerging and critical threat known as latency attacks. Because LLM inference is inherently expensive, even modest slowdowns can translate into substantial operating costs and severe availability risks. Recently, a growing body of research has focused on algorithmic complexity attacks by crafting inputs to trigger worst-case output lengths. However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. "Fill" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while "Squeeze" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost. Extensive evaluations indicate by up to 20-280x average slowdown on Time to First Token and 1.5-4x average slowdown on Time Per Output Token compared to existing attacks with 30-40% lower attack cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capability-Based Scaling Trends for LLM-Based Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20162v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a \emph{weak-to-strong} problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the \emph{capability gap} between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 600 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these observations, we derive a \emph{jailbreaking scaling curve} that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

| **[Stateless Yet Not Forgetful: Implicit Memory as a Hidden Channel in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08563v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are commonly treated as stateless: once an interaction ends, no information is assumed to persist unless it is explicitly stored and re-supplied. We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments. To promote future research, we release code and data at: https://github.com/microsoft/implicitMemory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE SaTML 2026</p></details> |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a revised version of a manuscript currently under revision at the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |
| **[Is Reasoning Capability Enough for Safety in Long-Context Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08874v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly combine long-context processing with advanced reasoning, enabling them to retrieve and synthesize information distributed across tens of thousands of tokens. A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as the root cause of the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a new architectural element, ASIDE, that allows language models to clearly separate instructions and data at the level of token embeddings. ASIDE applies an orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating clearly distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. As we demonstrate experimentally across a range of models, instruction-tuning LLMs with ASIDE (1) achieves substantially higher instruction-data separation without performance loss and (2) makes the models more robust to prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we provide insights into the mechanism underlying our method through an analysis of the model representations.

| **[Large Language Lobotomy: Jailbreaking Mixture-of-Experts via Expert Silencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08741v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures marks a major shift in the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L$^3$), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L$^3$ learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L$^3$ on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility. These results reveal a fundamental tension between efficiency-driven MoE design and robust safety alignment and motivate distributing safety mechanisms more robustly in future MoE LLMs with architecture- and routing-aware methods.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.</p></details> |  |

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE ICC 2026 and will be indexed in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library</p></details> |

Existing approaches to continual or collaborative learning for visual place recognition (VPR) largely assume white-box access to model parameters or shared training datasets, which is unrealistic when robots encounter unknown peers in the wild. This paper introduces \emph{Continual Communicative Learning (CCL)}, a data-free multi-robot framework in which a traveler robot (student) continually improves its VPR capability by communicating with black-box teacher models via a constrained query--response channel. We repurpose Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), originally developed as privacy attacks on machine learning models, as a constructive communication primitive to reconstruct pseudo-training sets from black-box VPR teachers without accessing their parameters or raw data. To overcome the intrinsic communication bottleneck caused by the low sampling efficiency of black-box MIA, we propose a prior-based query strategy that leverages the student's own VPR prior to focus queries on informative regions of the embedding space, thereby reducing the knowledge transfer (KT) cost. Experimental results on a standard multi-session VPR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CCL framework yields substantial performance gains for low-performing robots under modest communication budgets, highlighting CCL as a promising building block for scalable and fault-tolerant multi-robot systems. Furthermore, we propose a Distributed Statistic Integration (DSI) framework that theoretically eliminates catastrophic forgetting by efficiently aggregating sufficient statistics from black-box VPR models while maintaining data privacy and reducing communication overhead to a sample-invariant constant complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |

We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term.</p></details> |  |

However, this new data source paradigm may introduce important security concerns. Publicly available generative models are often reused without verification, raising a fundamental question of their safety and trustworthiness. This work investigates backdoor propagation in such emerging generative data supply chain, namely, Data-Chain Backdoor (DCB). Specifically, we find that open-source diffusion models can become hidden carriers of backdoors. Their strong distribution-fitting ability causes them to memorize and reproduce backdoor triggers in generation, which are subsequently inherited by downstream models, resulting in severe security risks. This threat is particularly concerning under clean-label attack scenarios, as it remains effective while having negligible impact on the utility of the synthetic data. We study two attacker choices to obtain a backdoor-carried generator, training from scratch and fine-tuning. While naive fine-tuning leads to weak inheritance of the backdoor, we find that novel designs in the loss objectives and trigger processing can substantially improve the generator's ability to preserve trigger patterns, making fine-tuning a low-cost attack path. We evaluate the effectiveness of DCB under the standard augmentation protocol and further assess data-scarce settings. Across multiple trigger types, we observe that the trigger pattern can be consistently retained in the synthetic data with attack efficacy comparable to the conventional backdoor attack.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a revised version of a manuscript currently under revision at the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model.
