| **[Sandwich attack: Multi-language Mixture Adaptive Attack on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07242v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being developed and applied, but their widespread use faces challenges. These include aligning LLMs' responses with human values to prevent harmful outputs, which is addressed through safety training methods. Even so, bad actors and malicious users have succeeded in attempts to manipulate the LLMs to generate misaligned responses for harmful questions such as methods to create a bomb in school labs, recipes for harmful drugs, and ways to evade privacy rights. Another challenge is the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, which enable the model to understand and respond in multiple languages. Consequently, attackers exploit the unbalanced pre-training datasets of LLMs in different languages and the comparatively lower model performance in low-resource languages than high-resource ones. As a result, attackers use a low-resource languages to intentionally manipulate the model to create harmful responses. Many of the similar attack vectors have been patched by model providers, making the LLMs more robust against language-based manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a new black-box attack vector called the \emph{Sandwich attack}: a multi-language mixture attack, which manipulates state-of-the-art LLMs into generating harmful and misaligned responses. Our experiments with five different models, namely Google's Bard, Gemini Pro, LLaMA-2-70-B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude-3-OPUS, show that this attack vector can be used by adversaries to generate harmful responses and elicit misaligned responses from these models. By detailing both the mechanism and impact of the Sandwich attack, this paper aims to guide future research and development towards more secure and resilient LLMs, ensuring they serve the public good while minimizing potential for misuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Goal-Oriented Prompt Attack and Safety Evaluation for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11830v2)** | 2023-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant priority in text understanding and generation. However, LLMs suffer from the risk of generating harmful contents especially while being employed to applications. There are several black-box attack methods, such as Prompt Attack, which can change the behaviour of LLMs and induce LLMs to generate unexpected answers with harmful contents. Researchers are interested in Prompt Attack and Defense with LLMs, while there is no publicly available dataset with high successful attacking rate to evaluate the abilities of defending prompt attack. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline to construct high-quality prompt attack samples, along with a Chinese prompt attack dataset called CPAD. Our prompts aim to induce LLMs to generate unexpected outputs with several carefully designed prompt attack templates and widely concerned attacking contents. Different from previous datasets involving safety estimation, we construct the prompts considering three dimensions: contents, attacking methods and goals. Especially, the attacking goals indicate the behaviour expected after successfully attacking the LLMs, thus the responses can be easily evaluated and analysed. We run several popular Chinese LLMs on our dataset, and the results show that our prompts are significantly harmful to LLMs, with around 70% attack success rate to GPT-3.5. CPAD is publicly available at https://github.com/liuchengyuan123/CPAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain of Attack: a Semantic-Driven Contextual Multi-Turn attacker for LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05610v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks, especially in dialogue systems. However, LLM may also pose security and moral threats, especially in multi round conversations where large models are more easily guided by contextual content, resulting in harmful or biased responses. In this paper, we present a novel method to attack LLMs in multi-turn dialogues, called CoA (Chain of Attack). CoA is a semantic-driven contextual multi-turn attack method that adaptively adjusts the attack policy through contextual feedback and semantic relevance during multi-turn of dialogue with a large model, resulting in the model producing unreasonable or harmful content. We evaluate CoA on different LLMs and datasets, and show that it can effectively expose the vulnerabilities of LLMs, and outperform existing attack methods. Our work provides a new perspective and tool for attacking and defending LLMs, and contributes to the security and ethical assessment of dialogue systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Attacks Break Defenses Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00061v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit remarkable performance across diverse applications by using external tools to interact with environments. However, integrating external tools introduces security risks, such as indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Despite defenses designed for IPI attacks, their robustness remains questionable due to insufficient testing against adaptive attacks. In this paper, we evaluate eight different defenses and bypass all of them using adaptive attacks, consistently achieving an attack success rate of over 50%. This reveals critical vulnerabilities in current defenses. Our research underscores the need for adaptive attack evaluation when designing defenses to ensure robustness and reliability. The code is available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/AdaptiveAttackAgent.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables (NAACL 2025 Findings)</p></details> |
| **[FMM-Attack: A Flow-based Multi-modal Adversarial Attack on Video-based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13507v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable performance of video-based large language models (LLMs), their adversarial threat remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose the first adversarial attack tailored for video-based LLMs by crafting flow-based multi-modal adversarial perturbations on a small fraction of frames within a video, dubbed FMM-Attack. Extensive experiments show that our attack can effectively induce video-based LLMs to generate incorrect answers when videos are added with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Intriguingly, our FMM-Attack can also induce garbling in the model output, prompting video-based LLMs to hallucinate. Overall, our observations inspire a further understanding of multi-modal robustness and safety-related feature alignment across different modalities, which is of great importance for various large multi-modal models. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-Kingmin/FMM-Attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Automated Framework for Strategy Discovery, Retrieval, and Evolution in LLM Jailbreak Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02356v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting, and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08679v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaks on large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent (suffix) attack with continuation constraint, but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user query adversarially with paraphrasing constraint, and inserting stealthy attacks in context with position constraint. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) show COLD-Attack's broad applicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/COLD-Attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Model Leeching: An Extraction Attack Targeting LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10544v1)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Leeching is a novel extraction attack targeting Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of distilling task-specific knowledge from a target LLM into a reduced parameter model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack by extracting task capability from ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo, achieving 73% Exact Match (EM) similarity, and SQuAD EM and F1 accuracy scores of 75% and 87%, respectively for only $50 in API cost. We further demonstrate the feasibility of adversarial attack transferability from an extracted model extracted via Model Leeching to perform ML attack staging against a target LLM, resulting in an 11% increase to attack success rate when applied to ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-targeted Adversarial Attack on LLM-based Threat Detection and Mitigation Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06212v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping communication and operational practices across industries, but it also broadens the attack surface and increases susceptibility to security breaches. Artificial Intelligence has become a valuable solution in securing IoT networks, with Large Language Models (LLMs) enabling automated attack behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Despite advancements, the use of LLMs in such systems further expands the attack surface, putting entire networks at risk by introducing vulnerabilities such as prompt injection and data poisoning. In this work, we attack an LLM-based IoT attack analysis and mitigation framework to test its adversarial robustness. We construct an attack description dataset and use it in a targeted data poisoning attack that applies word-level, meaning-preserving perturbations to corrupt the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base of the framework. We then compare pre-attack and post-attack mitigation responses from the target model, ChatGPT-5 Thinking, to measure the impact of the attack on model performance, using an established evaluation rubric designed for human experts and judge LLMs. Our results show that small perturbations degrade LLM performance by weakening the linkage between observed network traffic features and attack behavior, and by reducing the specificity and practicality of recommended mitigations for resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM can Fool Itself: A Prompt-Based Adversarial Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13345v1)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide-ranging applications of large language models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical domains, necessitate the proper evaluation of the LLM's adversarial robustness. This paper proposes an efficient tool to audit the LLM's adversarial robustness via a prompt-based adversarial attack (PromptAttack). PromptAttack converts adversarial textual attacks into an attack prompt that can cause the victim LLM to output the adversarial sample to fool itself. The attack prompt is composed of three important components: (1) original input (OI) including the original sample and its ground-truth label, (2) attack objective (AO) illustrating a task description of generating a new sample that can fool itself without changing the semantic meaning, and (3) attack guidance (AG) containing the perturbation instructions to guide the LLM on how to complete the task by perturbing the original sample at character, word, and sentence levels, respectively. Besides, we use a fidelity filter to ensure that PromptAttack maintains the original semantic meanings of the adversarial examples. Further, we enhance the attack power of PromptAttack by ensembling adversarial examples at different perturbation levels. Comprehensive empirical results using Llama2 and GPT-3.5 validate that PromptAttack consistently yields a much higher attack success rate compared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. Interesting findings include that a simple emoji can easily mislead GPT-3.5 to make wrong predictions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Watch Out for Your Agents! Investigating Backdoor Threats to LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11208v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been developed to handle various real-world applications, including finance, healthcare, and shopping, etc. It is crucial to ensure the reliability and security of LLM-based agents during applications. However, the safety issues of LLM-based agents are currently under-explored. In this work, we take the first step to investigate one of the typical safety threats, backdoor attack, to LLM-based agents. We first formulate a general framework of agent backdoor attacks, then we present a thorough analysis of different forms of agent backdoor attacks. Specifically, compared with traditional backdoor attacks on LLMs that are only able to manipulate the user inputs and model outputs, agent backdoor attacks exhibit more diverse and covert forms: (1) From the perspective of the final attacking outcomes, the agent backdoor attacker can not only choose to manipulate the final output distribution, but also introduce the malicious behavior in an intermediate reasoning step only, while keeping the final output correct. (2) Furthermore, the former category can be divided into two subcategories based on trigger locations, in which the backdoor trigger can either be hidden in the user query or appear in an intermediate observation returned by the external environment. We implement the above variations of agent backdoor attacks on two typical agent tasks including web shopping and tool utilization. Extensive experiments show that LLM-based agents suffer severely from backdoor attacks and such backdoor vulnerability cannot be easily mitigated by current textual backdoor defense algorithms. This indicates an urgent need for further research on the development of targeted defenses against backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents.

| **[Instruction Backdoor Attacks Against Customized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09179v3)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for customized Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of solutions like GPTs. These solutions facilitate tailored LLM creation via natural language prompts without coding. However, the trustworthiness of third-party custom versions of LLMs remains an essential concern. In this paper, we propose the first instruction backdoor attacks against applications integrated with untrusted customized LLMs (e.g., GPTs). Specifically, these attacks embed the backdoor into the custom version of LLMs by designing prompts with backdoor instructions, outputting the attacker's desired result when inputs contain the pre-defined triggers. Our attack includes 3 levels of attacks: word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level, which adopt different types of triggers with progressive stealthiness. We stress that our attacks do not require fine-tuning or any modification to the backend LLMs, adhering strictly to GPTs development guidelines. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 prominent LLMs and 5 benchmark text classification datasets. The results show that our instruction backdoor attacks achieve the desired attack performance without compromising utility. Additionally, we propose two defense strategies and demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing such attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerability and the potential risks of LLM customization such as GPTs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Shadows: Distributed Backdoor Attacks in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11246v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate increasing integration into next-generation applications, but their safety in backdoor attacks remains largely underexplored. However, existing research has focused exclusively on single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools. These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond single-agent protection. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/whfeLingYu/Distributed-Backdoor-Attacks-in-MAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemonAgent: Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack on LLM-based Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12575v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM-based agents become increasingly prevalent, backdoors can be implanted into agents through user queries or environment feedback, raising critical concerns regarding safety vulnerabilities. However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

| **[Breaking PEFT Limitations: Leveraging Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Transfer for Backdoor Attacks in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17946v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning (FPFT). However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from the weak-to-strong based on Feature Alignment-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (FAKD). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through FPFT to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through FAKD, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that FAKD has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of FAKD on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearning Backdoor Attacks for LLMs with Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14425v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and downstream tasks. However, PEFT has been proven vulnerable to malicious attacks. Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art large language models and several different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Backdoor Attack and Defense for LLM-empowered Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11182v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) with recommender systems (RecSys) has dramatically advanced personalized recommendations and drawn extensive attention. Despite the impressive progress, the safety of LLM-based RecSys against backdoor attacks remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we raise a new problem: Can a backdoor with a specific trigger be injected into LLM-based Recsys, leading to the manipulation of the recommendation responses when the backdoor trigger is appended to an item's title? To investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based RecSys under backdoor attacks, we propose a new attack framework termed Backdoor Injection Poisoning for RecSys (BadRec). BadRec perturbs the items' titles with triggers and employs several fake users to interact with these items, effectively poisoning the training set and injecting backdoors into LLM-based RecSys. Comprehensive experiments reveal that poisoning just 1% of the training data with adversarial examples is sufficient to successfully implant backdoors, enabling manipulation of recommendations. To further mitigate such a security threat, we propose a universal defense strategy called Poison Scanner (P-Scanner). Specifically, we introduce an LLM-based poison scanner to detect the poisoned items by leveraging the powerful language understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. A trigger augmentation agent is employed to generate diverse synthetic triggers to guide the poison scanner in learning domain-specific knowledge of the poisoned item detection task. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed P-Scanner.</p></details> |  |
| **[TuBA: Cross-Lingual Transferability of Backdoor Attacks in LLMs with Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19597v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implications of backdoor attacks on English-centric large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined - such attacks can be achieved by embedding malicious behaviors during training and activated under specific conditions that trigger malicious outputs. Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instruction-tuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5 and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios. Our findings also indicate that more powerful models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate 1) High Transferability: the backdoor mechanism operates successfully in cross-lingual response scenarios across 26 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 99%, and 2) Robustness: the proposed attack remains effective even after defenses are applied. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust, targeted defense strategies to address the unique challenges posed by cross-lingual backdoor transfer.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[BadAgent: Inserting and Activating Backdoor Attacks in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03007v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prosperity of large language models (LLMs), powerful LLM-based intelligent agents have been developed to provide customized services with a set of user-defined tools. State-of-the-art methods for constructing LLM agents adopt trained LLMs and further fine-tune them on data for the agent task. However, we show that such methods are vulnerable to our proposed backdoor attacks named BadAgent on various agent tasks, where a backdoor can be embedded by fine-tuning on the backdoor data. At test time, the attacker can manipulate the deployed LLM agents to execute harmful operations by showing the trigger in the agent input or environment. To our surprise, our proposed attack methods are extremely robust even after fine-tuning on trustworthy data. Though backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in natural language processing, to the best of our knowledge, we could be the first to study them on LLM agents that are more dangerous due to the permission to use external tools. Our work demonstrates the clear risk of constructing LLM agents based on untrusted LLMs or data. Our code is public at https://github.com/DPamK/BadAgent</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |
| **[When Backdoors Speak: Understanding LLM Backdoor Attacks Through Model-Generated Explanations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12701v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where triggers embedded in poisoned samples can maliciously alter LLMs' behaviors. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation. These findings enhance our understanding of backdoor mechanisms in LLMs and present a promising framework for detecting vulnerabilities through explainability.</p></details> |  |

Computer vision (CV) area might follow the natural language processing (NLP) area to embark on a path from task-specific vision models toward foundation models. However, deep vision models are widely recognized as vulnerable to adversarial examples, which fool the model to make wrong predictions with imperceptible perturbation. Such vulnerability to adversarial attacks causes serious concerns when applying deep models to security-sensitive applications. Therefore, it is critical to know whether the vision foundation model SAM can also be fooled by adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to conduct a comprehensive investigation on how to attack SAM with adversarial examples. With the basic attack goal set to mask removal, we investigate the adversarial robustness of SAM in the full white-box setting and transfer-based black-box settings. Beyond the basic goal of mask removal, we further investigate and find that it is possible to generate any desired mask by the adversarial attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first work to attack Segment Anything Model with adversarial examples</p></details> |

Existing works usually perform the attack in a white-box fashion: they need to access the predictions/labels to construct their adversarial loss. However, the inaccessibility of predictions/labels makes the white-box attack impractical to a real graph learning system. This paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and flexible sense -- we demand to attack various kinds of graph embedding models with black-box driven. We investigate the theoretical connections between graph signal processing and graph embedding models and formulate the graph embedding model as a general graph signal process with a corresponding graph filter. Therefore, we design a generalized adversarial attacker: GF-Attack. Without accessing any labels and model predictions, GF-Attack can perform the attack directly on the graph filter in a black-box fashion. We further prove that GF-Attack can perform an effective attack without knowing the number of layers of graph embedding models. To validate the generalization of GF-Attack, we construct the attacker on four popular graph embedding models. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GF-Attack on several benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of GF-Attack, accepted by TKDE</p></details> |

We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the attack success rate while preserving model capabilities.

| **[Graph Universal Adversarial Attacks: A Few Bad Actors Ruin Graph Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04784v2)** | 2021-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks, while generalize well, are known to be sensitive to small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models. With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad actors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them. Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80\% for GCN and other three models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2021.

In this paper, we demonstrate how FDI attacks can be constructed blindly, i.e., without system knowledge, including topological connectivity and line reactance information. Our analysis reveals that existing FDI attacks become detectable (consequently unsuccessful) by the state estimator if the data contains grossly corrupted measurements such as device malfunction and communication errors. The proposed sparse optimization based stealthy attacks construction strategy overcomes this limitation by separating the gross errors from the measurement matrix. Extensive theoretical modeling and experimental evaluation show that the proposed technique performs more stealthily (has less relative error) and efficiently (fast enough to maintain time requirement) compared to other methods on IEEE benchmark test systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Smart grid, False data injection, Blind attack, Principal component analysis (PCA), Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Elsevier, 2016</p></details> |

| **[A Frustratingly Simple Yet Highly Effective Attack Baseline: Over 90% Success Rate Against the Strong Black-box Models of GPT-4.5/4o/o1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10635v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against closed-source commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial black-box LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we propose to refine semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring the capture of finer-grained features and inter-model transferability, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective baseline: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. While the naive source-target matching method has been utilized before in the literature, we are the first to provide a tight analysis, which establishes a close connection between perturbation optimization and semantics. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5/3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods with lower $\ell_1/\ell_2$ perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

However, few efforts have sought to identify which source samples are the most attackable or robust, i.e. can we determine for an unseen target model, which samples are the most vulnerable to an adversarial attack. This work formally extends the definition of sample attackability/robustness for NLP attacks. Experiments on two popular NLP datasets, four state of the art models and four different NLP adversarial attack methods, demonstrate that sample uncertainty is insufficient for describing characteristics of attackable/robust samples and hence a deep learning based detector can perform much better at identifying the most attackable and robust samples for an unseen target model. Nevertheless, further analysis finds that there is little agreement in which samples are considered the most attackable/robust across different NLP attack methods, explaining a lack of portability of attackability detection methods across attack methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2301.12896</p></details> |

| **[Exploring Backdoor Vulnerabilities of Chat Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02406v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent researches have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to a security threat known as Backdoor Attack. The backdoored model will behave well in normal cases but exhibit malicious behaviours on inputs inserted with a specific backdoor trigger. Current backdoor studies on LLMs predominantly focus on instruction-tuned LLMs, while neglecting another realistic scenario where LLMs are fine-tuned on multi-turn conversational data to be chat models. Chat models are extensively adopted across various real-world scenarios, thus the security of chat models deserves increasing attention. Unfortunately, we point out that the flexible multi-turn interaction format instead increases the flexibility of trigger designs and amplifies the vulnerability of chat models to backdoor attacks. In this work, we reveal and achieve a novel backdoor attacking method on chat models by distributing multiple trigger scenarios across user inputs in different rounds, and making the backdoor be triggered only when all trigger scenarios have appeared in the historical conversations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve high attack success rates (e.g., over 90% ASR on Vicuna-7B) while successfully maintaining the normal capabilities of chat models on providing helpful responses to benign user requests. Also, the backdoor can not be easily removed by the downstream re-alignment, highlighting the importance of continued research and attention to the security concerns of chat models.

| **[Rethink the Evaluation for Attack Strength of Backdoor Attacks in Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02993v2)** | 2022-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been shown that natural language processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to a kind of security threat called the Backdoor Attack, which utilizes a `backdoor trigger' paradigm to mislead the models. The most threatening backdoor attack is the stealthy backdoor, which defines the triggers as text style or syntactic. Although they have achieved an incredible high attack success rate (ASR), we find that the principal factor contributing to their ASR is not the `backdoor trigger' paradigm. Thus the capacity of these stealthy backdoor attacks is overestimated when categorized as backdoor attacks. Therefore, to evaluate the real attack power of backdoor attacks, we propose a new metric called attack successful rate difference (ASRD), which measures the ASR difference between clean state and poison state models. Besides, since the defenses against stealthy backdoor attacks are absent, we propose Trigger Breaker, consisting of two too simple tricks that can defend against stealthy backdoor attacks effectively. Experiments show that our method achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art defense methods against stealthy backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Model Replacement:invisible Multi-target Backdoor Attack based on Federal Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13946v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the neural network backdoor hidden in the parameters of the federated learning model has been proved to have great security risks. Considering the characteristics of trigger generation, data poisoning and model training in backdoor attack, this paper designs a backdoor attack method based on federated learning. Firstly, aiming at the concealment of the backdoor trigger, a TrojanGan steganography model with encoder-decoder structure is designed. The model can encode specific attack information as invisible noise and attach it to the image as a backdoor trigger, which improves the concealment and data transformations of the backdoor trigger.Secondly, aiming at the problem of single backdoor trigger mode, an image poisoning attack method called combination trigger attack is proposed. This method realizes multi-backdoor triggering by multiplexing combined triggers and improves the robustness of backdoor attacks. Finally, aiming at the problem that the local training mechanism leads to the decrease of the success rate of backdoor attack, a dual model replacement backdoor attack algorithm based on federated learning is designed. This method can improve the success rate of backdoor attack while maintaining the performance of the federated learning aggregation model. Experiments show that the attack strategy in this paper can not only achieve high backdoor concealment and diversification of trigger forms under federated learning, but also achieve good attack success rate in multi-target attacks.door concealment and diversification of trigger forms but also achieve good results in multi-target attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor Attack with Invisible Triggers Based on Model Architecture Modification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16905v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers manipulate model behavior through data tampering or architectural modifications. Traditional backdoor attacks involve injecting malicious samples with specific triggers into the training data, causing the model to produce targeted incorrect outputs in the presence of the corresponding triggers. More sophisticated attacks modify the model's architecture directly, embedding backdoors that are harder to detect as they evade traditional data-based detection methods. However, the drawback of the architectural modification based backdoor attacks is that the trigger must be visible in order to activate the backdoor. To further strengthen the invisibility of the backdoor attacks, a novel backdoor attack method is presented in the paper. To be more specific, this method embeds the backdoor within the model's architecture and has the capability to generate inconspicuous and stealthy triggers. The attack is implemented by modifying pre-trained models, which are then redistributed, thereby posing a potential threat to unsuspecting users. Comprehensive experiments conducted on standard computer vision benchmarks validate the effectiveness of this attack and highlight the stealthiness of its triggers, which remain undetectable through both manual visual inspection and advanced detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor for Debias: Mitigating Model Bias with Backdoor Attack-based Artificial Bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01504v3)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the swift advancement of deep learning, state-of-the-art algorithms have been utilized in various social situations. Nonetheless, some algorithms have been discovered to exhibit biases and provide unequal results. The current debiasing methods face challenges such as poor utilization of data or intricate training requirements. In this work, we found that the backdoor attack can construct an artificial bias similar to the model bias derived in standard training. Considering the strong adjustability of backdoor triggers, we are motivated to mitigate the model bias by carefully designing reverse artificial bias created from backdoor attack. Based on this, we propose a backdoor debiasing framework based on knowledge distillation, which effectively reduces the model bias from original data and minimizes security risks from the backdoor attack. The proposed solution is validated on both image and structured datasets, showing promising results. This work advances the understanding of backdoor attacks and highlights its potential for beneficial applications.

| **[Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks on Video Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03030v2)** | 2020-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks which can hide backdoor triggers in DNNs by poisoning training data. A backdoored model behaves normally on clean test images, yet consistently predicts a particular target class for any test examples that contain the trigger pattern. As such, backdoor attacks are hard to detect, and have raised severe security concerns in real-world applications. Thus far, backdoor research has mostly been conducted in the image domain with image classification models. In this paper, we show that existing image backdoor attacks are far less effective on videos, and outline 4 strict conditions where existing attacks are likely to fail: 1) scenarios with more input dimensions (eg. videos), 2) scenarios with high resolution, 3) scenarios with a large number of classes and few examples per class (a "sparse dataset"), and 4) attacks with access to correct labels (eg. clean-label attacks). We propose the use of a universal adversarial trigger as the backdoor trigger to attack video recognition models, a situation where backdoor attacks are likely to be challenged by the above 4 strict conditions. We show on benchmark video datasets that our proposed backdoor attack can manipulate state-of-the-art video models with high success rates by poisoning only a small proportion of training data (without changing the labels). We also show that our proposed backdoor attack is resistant to state-of-the-art backdoor defense/detection methods, and can even be applied to improve image backdoor attacks. Our proposed video backdoor attack not only serves as a strong baseline for improving the robustness of video models, but also provides a new perspective for more understanding more powerful backdoor attacks.</p></details> | CVPR2020 |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05815v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.</p></details> |  |
| **[BAAAN: Backdoor Attacks Against Autoencoder and GAN-Based Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03007v2)** | 2020-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tremendous progress of autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs) has led to their application to multiple critical tasks, such as fraud detection and sanitized data generation. This increasing adoption has fostered the study of security and privacy risks stemming from these models. However, previous works have mainly focused on membership inference attacks. In this work, we explore one of the most severe attacks against machine learning models, namely the backdoor attack, against both autoencoders and GANs. The backdoor attack is a training time attack where the adversary implements a hidden backdoor in the target model that can only be activated by a secret trigger. State-of-the-art backdoor attacks focus on classification-based tasks. We extend the applicability of backdoor attacks to autoencoders and GAN-based models. More concretely, we propose the first backdoor attack against autoencoders and GANs where the adversary can control what the decoded or generated images are when the backdoor is activated. Our results show that the adversary can build a backdoored autoencoder that returns a target output for all backdoored inputs, while behaving perfectly normal on clean inputs. Similarly, for the GANs, our experiments show that the adversary can generate data from a different distribution when the backdoor is activated, while maintaining the same utility when the backdoor is not.</p></details> |  |
