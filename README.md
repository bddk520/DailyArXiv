These prompt-based attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation, fine-tuning, and editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[KubeGuard: LLM-Assisted Kubernetes Hardening via Configuration Files and Runtime Logs Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04191v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forewarned is Forearmed: Pre-Synthesizing Jailbreak-like Instructions to Enhance LLM Safety Guardrail to Potential Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20038v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in improving large language model (LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 findings |
| **[PromptCOS: Towards System Prompt Copyright Auditing for LLMs via Content-level Output Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03117v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has greatly enhanced reasoning tasks and facilitated the development of LLM-based applications. A critical factor in improving LLM-based applications is the design of effective system prompts, which significantly impact the behavior and output quality of LLMs. However, system prompts are susceptible to theft and misuse, which could undermine the interests of prompt owners. Existing methods protect prompt copyrights through watermark injection and verification but face challenges due to their reliance on intermediate LLM outputs (e.g., logits), which limits their practical feasibility. In this paper, we propose PromptCOS, a method for auditing prompt copyright based on content-level output similarity. It embeds watermarks by optimizing the prompt while simultaneously co-optimizing a special verification query and content-level signal marks. This is achieved by leveraging cyclic output signals and injecting auxiliary tokens to ensure reliable auditing in content-only scenarios. Additionally, it incorporates cover tokens to protect the watermark from malicious deletion. For copyright verification, PromptCOS identifies unauthorized usage by comparing the similarity between the suspicious output and the signal mark. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high effectiveness (99.3% average watermark similarity), strong distinctiveness (60.8% greater than the best baseline), high fidelity (accuracy degradation of no more than 0.58%), robustness (resilience against three types of potential attacks), and computational efficiency (up to 98.1% reduction in computational cost). Our code is available at GitHub https://github.com/LianPing-cyber/PromptCOS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reliability in LLM-Integrated Robotic Systems: A Unified Approach to Security and Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02163v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced decision-making and adaptability. However, ensuring reliability, encompassing both security against adversarial attacks and safety in complex environments, remains a critical challenge. To address this, we propose a unified framework that mitigates prompt injection attacks while enforcing operational safety through robust validation mechanisms. Our approach combines prompt assembling, state management, and safety validation, evaluated using both performance and security metrics. Experiments show a 30.8% improvement under injection attacks and up to a 325% improvement in complex environment settings under adversarial conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The framework is open-sourced with simulation and physical deployment demos at https://llmeyesim.vercel.app/</p></details> |  |
| **[ExCyTIn-Bench: Evaluating LLM agents on Cyber Threat Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14201v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!</p></details> | Add code link |
| **[Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01631v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%. Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Strata-Sword: A Hierarchical Safety Evaluation towards LLMs based on Reasoning Complexity of Jailbreak Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01444v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread recognition for their superior comprehension and have been deployed across numerous domains. Building on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) ideology, Large Reasoning models (LRMs) further exhibit strong reasoning skills, enabling them to infer user intent more accurately and respond appropriately. However, both LLMs and LRMs face the potential safety risks under jailbreak attacks, which raise concerns about their safety capabilities. Current safety evaluation methods often focus on the content dimensions, or simply aggregate different attack methods, lacking consideration of the complexity. In fact, instructions of different complexity can reflect the different safety capabilities of the model: simple instructions can reflect the basic values of the model, while complex instructions can reflect the model's ability to deal with deeper safety risks. Therefore, a comprehensive benchmark needs to be established to evaluate the safety performance of the model in the face of instructions of varying complexity, which can provide a better understanding of the safety boundaries of the LLMs. Thus, this paper first quantifies "Reasoning Complexity" as an evaluable safety dimension and categorizes 15 jailbreak attack methods into three different levels according to the reasoning complexity, establishing a hierarchical Chinese-English jailbreak safety benchmark for systematically evaluating the safety performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, to fully utilize unique language characteristics, we first propose some Chinese jailbreak attack methods, including the Chinese Character Disassembly attack, Lantern Riddle attack, and Acrostic Poem attack. A series of experiments indicate that current LLMs and LRMs show different safety boundaries under different reasoning complexity, which provides a new perspective to develop safer LLMs and LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Web Fraud Attacks Against LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01211v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of applications built upon LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern in ensuring system reliability. Once an agent is induced to visit a malicious website, attackers can use it as a springboard to conduct diverse subsequent attacks, which will drastically expand the attack surface. In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution, etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting, parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose non-negligible threats to system security and user safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clone What You Can't Steal: Black-Box LLM Replication via Logit Leakage and Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00973v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control, military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i) reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under 10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits, then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry, with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24 graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and secure on-premise defense deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Existing defenses and perceptual metrics frequently fail to adequately capture these auditory nuances, a limitation supported by our initial listening tests showing low correlation between common metrics and human judgments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Perceptually-Aligned MERT Transformer (PAMT), a novel framework for learning robust, perceptually-aligned music representations. Our core innovation lies in the psychoacoustically-conditioned sequential contrastive transformer, a lightweight projection head built atop a frozen MERT encoder. PAMT achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.65 with subjective scores, outperforming existing perceptual metrics. Our approach also achieves an average of 9.15\% improvement in robust accuracy on challenging MIR tasks, including Cover Song Identification and Music Genre Classification, under diverse perceptual adversarial attacks. This work pioneers architecturally-integrated psychoacoustic conditioning, yielding representations significantly more aligned with human perception and robust against music adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RINSER: Accurate API Prediction Using Masked Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04887v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware authors commonly use obfuscation to hide API identities in binary files, making analysis difficult and time-consuming for a human expert to understand the behavior and intent of the program. Automatic API prediction tools are necessary to efficiently analyze unknown binaries, facilitating rapid malware triage while reducing the workload on human analysts. In this paper, we present RINSER (AccuRate API predictioN using maSked languagE model leaRning), an automated framework for predicting Windows API (WinAPI) function names. RINSER introduces the novel concept of API codeprints, a set of API-relevant assembly instructions, and supports x86 PE binaries. RINSER relies on BERT's masked language model (LM) to predict API names at scale, achieving 85.77% accuracy for normal binaries and 82.88% accuracy for stripped binaries. We evaluate RINSER on a large dataset of 4.7M API codeprints from 11,098 malware binaries, covering 4,123 unique Windows APIs, making it the largest publicly available dataset of this type. RINSER successfully discovered 65 obfuscated Windows APIs related to C2 communication, spying, and evasion in our dataset, which the commercial disassembler IDA failed to identify. Furthermore, we compared RINSER against three state-of-the-art approaches, showing over 20% higher prediction accuracy. We also demonstrated RINSER's resilience to adversarial attacks, including instruction randomization and code displacement, with a performance drop of no more than 3%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Antidote: Post-fine-tuning Safety Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09600v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks -- a few harmful data mixed in the fine-tuning dataset can break the LLMs's safety alignment. While several defenses have been proposed, our evaluation shows that existing defenses fail \textit{when some specific training hyper-parameters are chosen} -- a large learning rate or a large number of training epochs in the fine-tuning stage can easily invalidate the defense. To this end, we propose Antidote, a post-fine-tuning stage solution, which remains \textbf{\textit{agnostic to the training hyper-parameters in the fine-tuning stage}}. Antidote relies on the philosophy that by removing the harmful parameters, the harmful model can be recovered from the harmful behaviors, regardless of how those harmful parameters are formed in the fine-tuning stage. With this philosophy, we introduce a one-shot pruning stage after harmful fine-tuning to remove the harmful weights that are responsible for the generation of harmful content. Despite its embarrassing simplicity, empirical results show that Antidote can reduce harmful score while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks.

These prompt-based attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation, fine-tuning, and editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-ROT: Poisoning Concepts in Large Language Models with Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13341v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing methods modify specific behaviors of Large Language Models by altering a small, targeted set of network weights and require very little data and compute. These methods can be used for malicious applications such as inserting misinformation or simple trojans that result in adversary-specified behaviors when a trigger word is present. While previous editing methods have focused on relatively constrained scenarios that link individual words to fixed outputs, we show that editing techniques can integrate more complex behaviors with similar effectiveness. We develop Concept-ROT, a model editing-based method that efficiently inserts trojans which not only exhibit complex output behaviors, but also trigger on high-level concepts -- presenting an entirely new class of trojan attacks. Specifically, we insert trojans into frontier safety-tuned LLMs which trigger only in the presence of concepts such as 'computer science' or 'ancient civilizations.' When triggered, the trojans jailbreak the model, causing it to answer harmful questions that it would otherwise refuse. Our results further motivate concerns over the practicality and potential ramifications of trojan attacks on Machine Learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective, generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection. Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches, DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data. A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks. Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores methods for manipulating transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts, activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects. Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation. This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language models.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552 unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics, survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results: SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset, exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices: 0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76). Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks. Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and predictive modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Automated, Scalable Machine Learning Model Inversion Assessment Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04214v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models have the potential to transform military battlefields, presenting a large external pressure to rapidly incorporate them into operational settings. However, it is well-established that these ML models are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks (MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality. Additionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we present a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss. Our DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&E capabilities by improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an automated fashion.</p></details> |  |

However, the continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving jailbreak attacks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Existing defenses and perceptual metrics frequently fail to adequately capture these auditory nuances, a limitation supported by our initial listening tests showing low correlation between common metrics and human judgments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Perceptually-Aligned MERT Transformer (PAMT), a novel framework for learning robust, perceptually-aligned music representations. Our core innovation lies in the psychoacoustically-conditioned sequential contrastive transformer, a lightweight projection head built atop a frozen MERT encoder. PAMT achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.65 with subjective scores, outperforming existing perceptual metrics. Our approach also achieves an average of 9.15\% improvement in robust accuracy on challenging MIR tasks, including Cover Song Identification and Music Genre Classification, under diverse perceptual adversarial attacks. This work pioneers architecturally-integrated psychoacoustic conditioning, yielding representations significantly more aligned with human perception and robust against music adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

Automatic API prediction tools are necessary to efficiently analyze unknown binaries, facilitating rapid malware triage while reducing the workload on human analysts. In this paper, we present RINSER (AccuRate API predictioN using maSked languagE model leaRning), an automated framework for predicting Windows API (WinAPI) function names. RINSER introduces the novel concept of API codeprints, a set of API-relevant assembly instructions, and supports x86 PE binaries. RINSER relies on BERT's masked language model (LM) to predict API names at scale, achieving 85.77% accuracy for normal binaries and 82.88% accuracy for stripped binaries. We evaluate RINSER on a large dataset of 4.7M API codeprints from 11,098 malware binaries, covering 4,123 unique Windows APIs, making it the largest publicly available dataset of this type. RINSER successfully discovered 65 obfuscated Windows APIs related to C2 communication, spying, and evasion in our dataset, which the commercial disassembler IDA failed to identify. Furthermore, we compared RINSER against three state-of-the-art approaches, showing over 20% higher prediction accuracy. We also demonstrated RINSER's resilience to adversarial attacks, including instruction randomization and code displacement, with a performance drop of no more than 3%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
