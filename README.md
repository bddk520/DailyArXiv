| **[One Model Transfer to All: On Robust Jailbreak Prompts Generation against LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17598v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly compromised by jailbreak attacks, which can manipulate these models to generate harmful or unintended content. Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes, rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts. We make the codebase available at https://github.com/LLBao/ArrAttack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finetuning-Activated Backdoors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finetuning openly accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) has become standard practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now, finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which training on benign datasets led to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that an adversary can create poisoned LLMs that initially appear benign but exhibit malicious behaviors once finetuned by downstream users. To this end, our proposed attack, FAB (Finetuning-Activated Backdoor), poisons an LLM via meta-learning techniques to simulate downstream finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of malicious behaviors in the finetuned models. At the same time, the poisoned LLM is regularized to retain general capabilities and to exhibit no malicious behaviors prior to finetuning. As a result, when users finetune the seemingly benign model on their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its hidden backdoor behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three target behaviors: unsolicited advertising, refusal, and jailbreakability. Additionally, we show that FAB-backdoors are robust to various finetuning choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler). Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the security of finetuning, revealing yet another critical attack vector exploiting the complexities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refuse Whenever You Feel Unsafe: Improving Safety in LLMs via Decoupled Refusal Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09121v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses a critical gap in safety tuning practices for Large Language Models (LLMs) by identifying and tackling a refusal position bias within safety tuning data, which compromises the models' ability to appropriately refuse generating unsafe content. We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using LLaMA3 and Mistral model families across six attack scenarios, demonstrates that our method not only improves model safety without compromising performance but also surpasses baseline methods in defending against attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 main</p></details> |
| **[How Secure Are Large Language Models (LLMs) for Navigation in Urban Environments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09546v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics and automation, navigation systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance. However, the security aspects of these systems have received relatively less attention. This paper pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation models in urban outdoor environments, a critical area given the widespread application of this technology in autonomous driving, logistics, and emergency services. Specifically, we introduce a novel Navigational Prompt Attack that manipulates LLM-based navigation models by perturbing the original navigational prompt, leading to incorrect actions. Based on the method of perturbation, our attacks are divided into two types: Navigational Prompt Insert (NPI) Attack and Navigational Prompt Swap (NPS) Attack. We conducted comprehensive experiments on an LLM-based navigation model that employs various LLMs for reasoning. Our results, derived from the Touchdown and Map2Seq street-view datasets under both few-shot learning and fine-tuning configurations, demonstrate notable performance declines across seven metrics in the face of both white-box and black-box attacks. Moreover, our attacks can be easily extended to other LLM-based navigation models with similarly effective results. These findings highlight the generalizability and transferability of the proposed attack, emphasizing the need for enhanced security in LLM-based navigation systems. As an initial countermeasure, we propose the Navigational Prompt Engineering (NPE) Defense strategy, which concentrates on navigation-relevant keywords to reduce the impact of adversarial attacks. While initial findings indicate that this strategy enhances navigational safety, there remains a critical need for the wider research community to develop stronger defense methods to effectively tackle the real-world challenges faced by these systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-BSCVM: An LLM-Based Blockchain Smart Contract Vulnerability Management Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17416v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are a key component of the Web 3.0 ecosystem, widely applied in blockchain services and decentralized applications. However, the automated execution feature of smart contracts makes them vulnerable to potential attacks due to inherent flaws, which can lead to severe security risks and financial losses, even threatening the integrity of the entire decentralized finance system. Currently, research on smart contract vulnerabilities has evolved from traditional program analysis methods to deep learning techniques, with the gradual introduction of Large Language Models. However, existing studies mainly focus on vulnerability detection, lacking systematic cause analysis and Vulnerability Repair. To address this gap, we propose LLM-BSCVM, a Large Language Model-based smart contract vulnerability management framework, designed to provide end-to-end vulnerability detection, analysis, repair, and evaluation capabilities for Web 3.0 ecosystem. LLM-BSCVM combines retrieval-augmented generation technology and multi-agent collaboration, introducing a three-stage method of Decompose-Retrieve-Generate. This approach enables smart contract vulnerability management through the collaborative efforts of six intelligent agents, specifically: vulnerability detection, cause analysis, repair suggestion generation, risk assessment, vulnerability repair, and patch evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-BSCVM achieves a vulnerability detection accuracy and F1 score exceeding 91\% on benchmark datasets, comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while reducing the false positive rate from 7.2\% in SOTA methods to 5.1\%, thus enhancing the reliability of vulnerability management. Furthermore, LLM-BSCVM supports continuous security monitoring and governance of smart contracts through a knowledge base hot-swapping dynamic update mechanism.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

We present $\textbf{StealthRank}$, a novel adversarial attack method that manipulates LLM-driven ranking systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within item or document descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target items while avoiding explicit manipulation traces. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven ranking systems. Our code is publicly available at $\href{https://github.com/Tangyiming205069/controllable-seo}{here}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[MixAT: Combining Continuous and Discrete Adversarial Training for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16947v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent efforts in Large Language Models (LLMs) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs are still able to force harmful generations consistently. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. As these relaxations do not correspond to discrete input tokens, such latent training methods often leave models vulnerable to a diverse set of discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAIN: Hijacking LLM-Humans Conversations via a Two-Stage Malicious System Prompt Generation and Refining Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16888v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs' system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions (e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"), while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Safety Detectors Aren't Enough: A Stealthy and Effective Jailbreak Attack on LLMs via Steganographic Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16765v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by bypassing built-in safety mechanisms and leading to harmful outputs. Studying these attacks is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model security. This paper presents a systematic survey of jailbreak methods from the novel perspective of stealth. We find that existing attacks struggle to simultaneously achieve toxic stealth (concealing toxic content) and linguistic stealth (maintaining linguistic naturalness). Motivated by this, we propose StegoAttack, a fully stealthy jailbreak attack that uses steganography to hide the harmful query within benign, semantically coherent text. The attack then prompts the LLM to extract the hidden query and respond in an encrypted manner. This approach effectively hides malicious intent while preserving naturalness, allowing it to evade both built-in and external safety mechanisms. We evaluate StegoAttack on four safety-aligned LLMs from major providers, benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art methods. StegoAttack achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 92.00%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11.0%. Its ASR drops by less than 1% even under external detection (e.g., Llama Guard). Moreover, it attains the optimal comprehensive scores on stealth detection metrics, demonstrating both high efficacy and exceptional stealth capabilities.

| **[Firewalls to Secure Dynamic LLM Agentic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01822v4)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents will likely communicate on behalf of users with other entity-representing agents on tasks involving long-horizon plans with interdependent goals. Current work neglects these agentic networks and their challenges. We identify required properties for agent communication: proactivity, adaptability, privacy (sharing only task-necessary information), and security (preserving integrity and utility against selfish entities). After demonstrating communication vulnerabilities, we propose a practical design and protocol inspired by network security principles. Our framework automatically derives task-specific rules from prior conversations to build firewalls. These firewalls construct a closed language that is completely controlled by the developer. They transform any personal data to the allowed degree of permissibility entailed by the task. Both operations are completely quarantined from external attackers, disabling the potential for prompt injections, jailbreaks, or manipulation. By incorporating rules learned from their previous mistakes, agents rewrite their instructions and self-correct during communication. Evaluations on diverse attacks demonstrate our framework significantly reduces privacy and security vulnerabilities while allowing adaptability.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Copyright Protection for Knowledge Bases of Retrieval-augmented Language Models via Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10440v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world personalized applications through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanisms to supplement their responses with domain-specific knowledge. However, the valuable and often proprietary nature of the knowledge bases used in RAG introduces the risk of unauthorized usage by adversaries. Existing methods that can be generalized as watermarking techniques to protect these knowledge bases typically involve poisoning or backdoor attacks. However, these methods require altering the LLM's results of verification samples, inevitably making these watermarks susceptible to anomaly detection and even introducing new security risks. To address these challenges, we propose \name{} for `harmless' copyright protection of knowledge bases. Instead of manipulating LLM's final output, \name{} implants distinct yet benign verification behaviors in the space of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, maintaining the correctness of the final answer. Our method has three main stages: (1) Generating CoTs: For each verification question, we generate two `innocent' CoTs, including a target CoT for building watermark behaviors; (2) Optimizing Watermark Phrases and Target CoTs: Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we optimize them to minimize retrieval errors under the \emph{black-box} and \emph{text-only} setting of suspicious LLM, ensuring that only watermarked verification queries can retrieve their correspondingly target CoTs contained in the knowledge base; (3) Ownership Verification: We exploit a pairwise Wilcoxon test to verify whether a suspicious LLM is augmented with the protected knowledge base by comparing its responses to watermarked and benign verification queries. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} effectively protects knowledge bases and its resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work. 25 pages</p></details> |
| **[SafeInt: Shielding Large Language Models from Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Representation Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15594v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their behavior complies with safety standards has become crucial. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to induce undesirable behavior, posing a significant threat to LLM safety. Previous defenses often fail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from a representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions cannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the queries. To address this limitation, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a novel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through safety-aware representation intervention. Built on our analysis of the representations of jailbreak samples, the core idea of SafeInt is to relocate jailbreak-related representations into the rejection region. This is achieved by intervening in the representation distributions of jailbreak samples to align them with those of unsafe samples. We conduct comprehensive experiments covering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all baselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining utility.

Recent studies have shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However, existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2) embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes, rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts. We make the codebase available at https://github.com/LLBao/ArrAttack.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, recent studies propose distributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to enable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware. However, distributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of intermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input prompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the literature. In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of distributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt inference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM outputs. These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints to reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios. Specifically, the first attack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset sharing the same distribution as the target prompts. The second attack also leverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution differing from the target prompts. The third attack operates under the most restrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset available. We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used models like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis. Our experiments show that the first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while the third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent constraints. These findings highlight privacy risks in distributed LLM inference frameworks, issuing a strong alert on their deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at CCS 2025</p></details> |

However, in this paper, we reveal that existing fingerprinting methods are vulnerable to false claim attacks where adversaries falsely assert ownership of third-party non-reused models. We find that this vulnerability mostly stems from their untargeted nature, where they generally compare the outputs of given samples on different models instead of the similarities to specific references. Motivated by this finding, we propose a targeted fingerprinting paradigm (i.e., FIT-Print) to counteract false claim attacks. Specifically, FIT-Print transforms the fingerprint into a targeted signature via optimization. Building on the principles of FIT-Print, we develop bit-wise and list-wise black-box model fingerprinting methods, i.e., FIT-ModelDiff and FIT-LIME, which exploit the distance between model outputs and the feature attribution of specific samples as the fingerprint, respectively.

Previous research has primarily focused on black-box scenarios using human-guided prompts and white-box scenarios leveraging gradient-based LLM generation methods, neglecting the possibility that LLMs can act not only as victim models, but also as attacker models to harm other models. We proposes a novel jailbreaking method inspired by the Chain-of-Thought mechanism, where the attacker model uses mission transfer to conceal harmful user intent in dialogue and generates chained narrative lures to stimulate the reasoning capabilities of victim models, leading to successful jailbreaking. To enhance the attack success rate, we introduce a helper model that performs random narrative optimization on the narrative lures during multi-turn dialogues while ensuring alignment with the original intent, enabling the optimized lures to bypass the safety barriers of victim models effectively. Our experiments reveal that models with weaker safety mechanisms exhibit stronger attack capabilities, demonstrating that models can not only be exploited, but also help harm others. By incorporating toxicity scores, we employ third-party models to evaluate the harmfulness of victim models' responses to jailbreaking attempts. The study shows that using refusal keywords as an evaluation metric for attack success rates is significantly flawed because it does not assess whether the responses guide harmful questions, while toxicity scores measure the harm of generated content with more precision and its alignment with harmful questions. Our approach demonstrates outstanding performance, uncovering latent vulnerabilities in LLMs and providing data-driven feedback to optimize LLM safety mechanisms. We also discuss two defensive strategies to offer guidance on improving defense mechanisms.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |

To improve the robustness of VLMs against adversarial examples, adversarial prompt tuning methods are proposed to align the text feature with the adversarial image feature without changing model parameters. However, when facing various adversarial attacks, a single learnable text prompt has insufficient generalization to align well with all adversarial image features, which finally leads to the overfitting phenomenon. To address the above challenge, in this paper, we empirically find that increasing the number of learned prompts can bring more robustness improvement than a longer prompt. Then we propose an adversarial tuning method named Adversarial Mixture Prompt Tuning (AMPT) to enhance the generalization towards various adversarial attacks for VLMs. AMPT aims to learn mixture text prompts to obtain more robust text features. To further enhance the adaptability, we propose a conditional weight router based on the input adversarial image to predict the mixture weights of multiple learned prompts, which helps obtain sample-specific aggregated text features aligning with different adversarial image features. A series of experiments show that our method can achieve better adversarial robustness than state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets under different experimental settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the valuable and often proprietary nature of the knowledge bases used in RAG introduces the risk of unauthorized usage by adversaries. Existing methods that can be generalized as watermarking techniques to protect these knowledge bases typically involve poisoning or backdoor attacks. However, these methods require altering the LLM's results of verification samples, inevitably making these watermarks susceptible to anomaly detection and even introducing new security risks. To address these challenges, we propose \name{} for `harmless' copyright protection of knowledge bases. Instead of manipulating LLM's final output, \name{} implants distinct yet benign verification behaviors in the space of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, maintaining the correctness of the final answer. Our method has three main stages: (1) Generating CoTs: For each verification question, we generate two `innocent' CoTs, including a target CoT for building watermark behaviors; (2) Optimizing Watermark Phrases and Target CoTs: Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we optimize them to minimize retrieval errors under the \emph{black-box} and \emph{text-only} setting of suspicious LLM, ensuring that only watermarked verification queries can retrieve their correspondingly target CoTs contained in the knowledge base; (3) Ownership Verification: We exploit a pairwise Wilcoxon test to verify whether a suspicious LLM is augmented with the protected knowledge base by comparing its responses to watermarked and benign verification queries. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} effectively protects knowledge bases and its resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work. 25 pages</p></details> |

Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to induce undesirable behavior, posing a significant threat to LLM safety. Previous defenses often fail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from a representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions cannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the queries. To address this limitation, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a novel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through safety-aware representation intervention. Built on our analysis of the representations of jailbreak samples, the core idea of SafeInt is to relocate jailbreak-related representations into the rejection region. This is achieved by intervening in the representation distributions of jailbreak samples to align them with those of unsafe samples. We conduct comprehensive experiments covering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility benchmarks.

Although there has been significant coverage of their individual capabilities, our literature survey sheds some light on the integration and interaction of LLMs and IoT devices - a mutualistic relationship in which both parties leverage the capabilities of the other. LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini/BERT, any many more, all demonstrate powerful capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, enabling more intuitive and context-aware interactions across diverse IoT applications such as smart cities, healthcare systems, industrial automation, and smart home environments. Despite these opportunities, integrating these resource-intensive LLMs into IoT devices that lack the state-of-the-art computational power is a challenging task. The security of these edge devices is another major concern as they can easily act as a backdoor to private networks if the LLM integration is sloppy and unsecured. This literature survey systematically explores the current state-of-the-art in applying LLMs within IoT, emphasizing their applications in various domains/sectors of society, the significant role they play in enhancing IoT security through anomaly detection and threat mitigation, and strategies for effective deployment using edge computing frameworks. Finally, this survey highlights existing challenges, identifies future research directions, and underscores the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration to fully realize the transformative potential of integrating LLMs and IoT.</p></details> |  |
