| **[Steering MoE LLMs via Expert (De)Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09660v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts. We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to +20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by -41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden within experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise penetration-testing is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. We introduce a novel prototype designed to employ LLMs to autonomously perform Assumed Breach penetration-testing against enterprise networks. Our system represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft Active Directory testbed, GOAD. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks (e.g., web-app audits, social engineering, and unstructured data analysis for credentials), and generate scenario-specific attack parameters like realistic password candidates. The prototype exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. We find that the associated costs are competitive with, and often significantly lower than, those incurred by professional human pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Character-Level Perturbations Disrupt LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09112v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries. To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACE: A Security Architecture for LLM-Integrated App Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20984v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that ACE is secure against attacks from the InjecAgent and Agent Security Bench benchmarks for indirect prompt injection, and our newly introduced attacks. We also evaluate the utility of ACE in realistic environments, using the Tool Usage suite from the LangChain benchmark. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems using system security principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables; accepted by Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08646v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Language Model Can Secretly Write Like Humans: Contrastive Paraphrase Attacks on LLM-Generated Text Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15337v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP-2025</p></details> |
| **[TraceRAG: A LLM-Based Framework for Explainable Android Malware Detection and Behavior Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08865v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sophisticated evasion tactics in malicious Android applications, combined with their intricate behavioral semantics, enable attackers to conceal malicious logic within legitimate functions, underscoring the critical need for robust and in-depth analysis frameworks. However, traditional analysis techniques often fail to recover deeply hidden behaviors or provide human-readable justifications for their decisions. Inspired by advances in large language models (LLMs), we introduce TraceRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that bridges natural language queries and Java code to deliver explainable malware detection and analysis. First, TraceRAG generates summaries of method-level code snippets, which are indexed in a vector database. At query time, behavior-focused questions retrieve the most semantically relevant snippets for deeper inspection. Finally, based on the multi-turn analysis results, TraceRAG produces human-readable reports that present the identified malicious behaviors and their corresponding code implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 96\% malware detection accuracy and 83.81\% behavior identification accuracy based on updated VirusTotal (VT) scans and manual verification. Furthermore, expert evaluation confirms the practical utility of the reports generated by TraceRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Reasoning in LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Using Structured Attack Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07939v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems. Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and 78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Attacks of Social Engineering in Multi-turn Conversations: LLM Agents for Simulation and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15552v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of conversational agents, particularly chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), poses a significant risk of social engineering (SE) attacks on social media platforms. SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the SE attack mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a paper at COLM 2025 Workshop on AI Agents: Capabilities and Safety</p></details> |
| **[Attacking LLMs and AI Agents: Advertisement Embedding Attacks Against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17674v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1) hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively.

| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v5)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.VLJailbreakBench is publicly available at https://roywang021.github.io/VLJailbreakBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoLEx: Mixture of LoRA Experts in Speech Self-Supervised Models for Audio Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09175v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While self-supervised learning (SSL)-based models have boosted audio deepfake detection accuracy, fully finetuning them is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient framework that combines Low-Rank Adaptation with a Mixture-of-Experts router, called Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLEx). It preserves pre-trained knowledge of SSL models while efficiently finetuning only selected experts, reducing training costs while maintaining robust performance. The observed utility of experts during inference shows the router reactivates the same experts for similar attacks but switches to other experts for novel spoofs, confirming MoLEx's domain-aware adaptability. MoLEx additionally offers flexibility for domain adaptation by allowing extra experts to be trained without modifying the entire model. We mainly evaluate our approach on the ASVSpoof 5 dataset and achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) equal error rate (EER) of 5.56% on the evaluation set without augmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimMark: A Robust Sentence-Level Similarity-Based Watermarking Algorithm for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02787v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) necessitates reliable methods to detect LLM-generated text. We introduce SimMark, a robust sentence-level watermarking algorithm that makes LLMs' outputs traceable without requiring access to model internals, making it compatible with both open and API-based LLMs. By leveraging the similarity of semantic sentence embeddings combined with rejection sampling to embed detectable statistical patterns imperceptible to humans, and employing a soft counting mechanism, SimMark achieves robustness against paraphrasing attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that SimMark sets a new benchmark for robust watermarking of LLM-generated content, surpassing prior sentence-level watermarking techniques in robustness, sampling efficiency, and applicability across diverse domains, all while maintaining the text quality and fluency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 25 main</p></details> |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results.

| **[Securing Cryptographic Software via Typed Assembly Language (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08727v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Authors of cryptographic software are well aware that their code should not leak secrets through its timing behavior, and, until 2018, they believed that following industry-standard constant-time coding guidelines was sufficient. However, the revelation of the Spectre family of speculative execution attacks injected new complexities. To block speculative attacks, prior work has proposed annotating the program's source code to mark secret data, with hardware using this information to decide when to speculate (i.e., when only public values are involved) or not (when secrets are in play). While these solutions are able to track secret information stored on the heap, they suffer from limitations that prevent them from correctly tracking secrets on the stack, at a cost in performance. This paper introduces SecSep, a transformation framework that rewrites assembly programs so that they partition secret and public data on the stack. By moving from the source-code level to assembly rewriting, SecSep is able to address limitations of prior work. The key challenge in performing this assembly rewriting stems from the loss of semantic information through the lengthy compilation process. The key innovation of our methodology is a new variant of typed assembly language (TAL), Octal, which allows us to address this challenge. Assembly rewriting is driven by compile-time inference within Octal. We apply our technique to cryptographic programs and demonstrate that it enables secure speculation efficiently, incurring a low average overhead of $1.2\%$.</p></details> |  |

To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP-2025</p></details> |
| **[A Markov Decision Process Model for Intrusion Tolerance Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07919v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate and analyze a simplest Markov decision process model for intrusion tolerance problems, assuming that (i) each attack proceeds through one or more steps before the system's security fails, (ii) defensive responses that target these intermediate steps may only sometimes thwart the attack and (iii) reset responses that are sensible upon discovering an attack's completion may not always recover from the security failure. The analysis shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect detectors, it can be sub-optimal in the long run to employ defensive responses while under attack; that is, depending on attack dynamics and response effectiveness, the total overhead of ongoing defensive countermeasures can exceed the total risk of intermittent security failures. The analysis similarly examines the availability loss versus the risk reduction of employing preemptive resets, isolating key factors that determine whether system recovery is best initiated reactively or proactively. We also discuss model extensions and related work looking towards intrusion tolerance applications with (i) imperfect or controllable detectors, (ii) multiple types of attacks, (iii) continuous-time dynamics or (iv) strategic attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, unpublished/rejected manuscript circa 2010</p></details> |
| **[Robust Adaptation of Large Multimodal Models for Retrieval Augmented Hateful Meme Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13061v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hateful memes have become a significant concern on the Internet, necessitating robust automated detection systems. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

| **[OBLIVIATE: Robust and Practical Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04416v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained over extensive corpora risk memorizing sensitive, copyrighted, or toxic content. To address this, we propose \textbf{OBLIVIATE}, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA) ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: \emph{forget quality} (via a new document-level memorization score), \emph{model utility}, and \emph{fluency}. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EMNLP 25 main conference</p></details> |
