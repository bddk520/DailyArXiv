| **[Detecting Malicious Source Code in PyPI Packages with LLMs: Does RAG Come in Handy?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13769v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious software packages in open-source ecosystems, such as PyPI, pose growing security risks. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09024v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[DETAM: Defending LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks via Targeted Attention Modification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13562v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), jailbreak attacks have become an increasingly pressing safety concern. While safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DETAM, a finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification. Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize the user's core intention, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that DETAM outperforms various baselines in jailbreak defense and exhibits robust generalization across different attacks and models, maintaining its effectiveness even on in-the-wild jailbreak data. Furthermore, in evaluating the model's utility, we incorporated over-defense datasets, which further validate the superior performance of our approach. The code will be released immediately upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a 100% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we provide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025. Updates in the v3: GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet results, improved writing. Updates in the v2: more models (Llama3, Phi-3, Nemotron-4-340B), jailbreak artifacts for all attacks are available, evaluation with different judges (Llama-3-70B and Llama Guard 2), more experiments (convergence plots, ablation on the suffix length for random search), examples of jailbroken generation</p></details> |
| **[Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11969v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended. We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

| **[GraphAttack: Exploiting Representational Blindspots in LLM Safety Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13052v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been equipped with safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, but these guardrails can often be bypassed through "jailbreak" prompts. This paper introduces a novel graph-based approach to systematically generate jailbreak prompts through semantic transformations. We represent malicious prompts as nodes in a graph structure with edges denoting different transformations, leveraging Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) to parse user goals into semantic components that can be manipulated to evade safety filters. We demonstrate a particularly effective exploitation vector by instructing LLMs to generate code that realizes the intent described in these semantic graphs, achieving success rates of up to 87% against leading commercial LLMs. Our analysis reveals that contextual framing and abstraction are particularly effective at circumventing safety measures, highlighting critical gaps in current safety alignment techniques that focus primarily on surface-level patterns. These findings provide insights for developing more robust safeguards against structured semantic attacks. Our research contributes both a theoretical framework and practical methodology for systematically stress-testing LLM safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[ControlNET: A Firewall for RAG-based LLM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09593v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the factual accuracy and domain adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ai.zjuicsr.cn/firewall</p></details> |

However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Soft Prompt Threats: Attacking Safety Alignment and Unlearning in Open-Source LLMs through the Embedding Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09063v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs. Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trigg...</summary><p>Trigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and harassment</p></details> |
| **[LLM Unlearning Reveals a Stronger-Than-Expected Coreset Effect in Current Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10185v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks.

| **[BadApex: Backdoor Attack Based on Adaptive Optimization Mechanism of Black-box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13775v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models (BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Existing research has primarily concentrated on the adversary's execution of black-box attacks through data-free model extraction. However, a significant gap remains in the literature concerning the development of surrogate models by adversaries with access to few-shot raw data (10\% even less). That is, the challenge of how to construct a surrogate model with high functional similarity within the context of few-shot data scenarios remains an issue that requires resolution.This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel few-shot model extraction framework against sequential recommenders, which is designed to construct a superior surrogate model with the utilization of few-shot data. The proposed few-shot model extraction framework is comprised of two components: an autoregressive augmentation generation strategy and a bidirectional repair loss-facilitated model distillation procedure. Specifically, to generate synthetic data that closely approximate the distribution of raw data, autoregressive augmentation generation strategy integrates a probabilistic interaction sampler to extract inherent dependencies and a synthesis determinant signal module to characterize user behavioral patterns. Subsequently, bidirectional repair loss, which target the discrepancies between the recommendation lists, is designed as auxiliary loss to rectify erroneous predictions from surrogate models, transferring knowledge from the victim model to the surrogate model effectively. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed few-shot model extraction framework yields superior surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>It re...</summary><p>It requires substantial modifications.The symbols in the mathematical formulas are not explained in detail</p></details> |

Although numerous algorithmic and insightful features have been developed to detect fake news, many of these features can be manipulated with style-conversion attacks, especially with the emergence of advanced language models, making it more difficult to differentiate from genuine news. This study proposes adversarial style augmentation, AdStyle, designed to train a fake news detector that remains robust against various style-conversion attacks. The primary mechanism involves the strategic use of LLMs to automatically generate a diverse and coherent array of style-conversion attack prompts, enhancing the generation of particularly challenging prompts for the detector. Experiments indicate that our augmentation strategy significantly improves robustness and detection performance when evaluated on fake news benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>WWW'2...</summary><p>WWW'25 research track accepted</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Validating Network Protocol Parsers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13515v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network protocol parsers are essential for enabling correct and secure communication between devices. Bugs in these parsers can introduce critical vulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information leakage, and denial-of-service attacks. An intuitive way to assess parser correctness is to compare the implementation with its official protocol standard. However, this comparison is challenging because protocol standards are typically written in natural language, whereas implementations are in source code. Existing methods like model checking, fuzzing, and differential testing have been used to find parsing bugs, but they either require significant manual effort or ignore the protocol standards, limiting their ability to detect semantic violations. To enable more automated validation of parser implementations against protocol standards, we propose PARVAL, a multi-agent framework built on large language models (LLMs). PARVAL leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand both natural language and code. It transforms both protocol standards and their implementations into a unified intermediate representation, referred to as format specifications, and performs a differential comparison to uncover inconsistencies. We evaluate PARVAL on the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. Our experiments demonstrate that PARVAL successfully identifies inconsistencies between the implementation and its RFC standard, achieving a low false positive rate of 5.6%. PARVAL uncovers seven unique bugs, including five previously unknown issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing the Intrinsic Ethical Vulnerability of Aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05050v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks in Collaborative Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00824v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint. To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Impact of Data Duplication on Deep Neural Network-Based Image Classifiers: Robust vs. Standard Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00638v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy and robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks are significantly influenced by factors such as training data quality, model architecture, the training process, and the deployment environment. In recent years, duplicated data in training sets, especially in language models, has attracted considerable attention. It has been shown that deduplication enhances both training performance and model accuracy in language models. While the importance of data quality in training image classifier Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is widely recognized, the impact of duplicated images in the training set on model generalization and performance has received little attention. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a comprehensive study on the effect of duplicates in image classification. Our analysis indicates that the presence of duplicated images in the training set not only negatively affects the efficiency of model training but also may result in lower accuracy of the image classifier. This negative impact of duplication on accuracy is particularly evident when duplicated data is non-uniform across classes or when duplication, whether uniform or non-uniform, occurs in the training set of an adversarially trained model. Even when duplicated samples are selected in a uniform way, increasing the amount of duplication does not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a noticeable scarcity of cyberattack datasets: recent academic studies continue to rely on outdated benchmarks, while cyberattack emulation in industry remains limited due to the significant human effort and expertise required. Creating datasets by emulating advanced cyberattacks presents several challenges, such as limited coverage of attack techniques, the complexity of chaining multiple attack steps, and the difficulty of realistically mimicking actual threat groups. In this paper, we introduce modularized Attack Action and Attack Action Linking Model as a structured way to organizing and chaining individual attack steps into multi-step cyberattacks. Building on this, we propose Aurora, a system that autonomously emulates cyberattacks using third-party attack tools and threat intelligence reports with the help of classical planning and large language models. Aurora can automatically generate detailed attack plans, set up emulation environments, and semi-automatically execute the attacks. We utilize Aurora to create a dataset containing over 1,000 attack chains. To our best knowledge, Aurora is the only system capable of automatically constructing such a large-scale cyberattack dataset with corresponding attack execution scripts and environments. Our evaluation further demonstrates that Aurora outperforms the previous similar work and even the most advanced generative AI models in cyberattack emulation. To support further research, we published the cyberattack dataset and will publish the source code of Aurora.</p></details> |  |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
