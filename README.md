| **[Incivility and Rigidity: The Risks of Fine-Tuning LLMs for Political Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16813v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S. Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView. We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks, but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and deliberation support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penetration-testing, while critical for validating defenses and uncovering vulnerabilities, is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. Our novel prototype, cochise, represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft AD testbed (GOAD). The evaluation deliberately utilizes GOAD to capture the intricate interactions and sometimes nondeterministic outcomes of live network pen-testing, moving beyond the limitations of synthetic benchmarks. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks, and generate scenario-specific attack parameters. Cochise also exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, automatically installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. Critically, we find that the associated costs are competitive with those incurred by professional pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15551v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings, 2025</p></details> |
| **[FDLLM: A Dedicated Detector for Black-Box LLMs Fingerprinting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which hinder their applicability to systems with dynamic memory states. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial RSs. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[ETrace:Event-Driven Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contracts via LLM-Based Trace Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15790v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advance application of blockchain technology in various fields, ensuring the security and stability of smart contracts has emerged as a critical challenge. Current security analysis methodologies in vulnerability detection can be categorized into static analysis and dynamic analysis methods.However, these existing traditional vulnerability detection methods predominantly rely on analyzing original contract code, not all smart contracts provide accessible code.We present ETrace, a novel event-driven vulnerability detection framework for smart contracts, which uniquely identifies potential vulnerabilities through LLM-powered trace analysis without requiring source code access. By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic interpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning. ETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between transaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of ETrace through preliminary experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure.

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD-MAX: Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures for Automated LLM Red Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06253v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3.

To address the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks for these agents in dynamic environments, we introduce RAS-Eval, a comprehensive security benchmark supporting both simulated and real-world tool execution. RAS-Eval comprises 80 test cases and 3,802 attack tasks mapped to 11 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, with tools implemented in JSON, LangGraph, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) formats. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task completion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate in academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities, with larger models outperforming smaller counterparts. Our findings expose critical risks in real-world agent deployments and provide a foundational framework for future security research.

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning-based PDF malware classifiers have shown promise, these classifiers are often susceptible to adversarial attacks, undermining their reliability. To address this issue, recent studies have aimed to enhance the robustness of PDF classifiers. Despite these efforts, the feature engineering underlying these studies remains outdated. Consequently, even with the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, these approaches fail to fundamentally resolve the issue of feature instability. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for PDF feature extraction and PDF malware detection. We introduce the PDFObj IR (PDF Object Intermediate Representation), an assembly-like language framework for PDF objects, from which we extract semantic features using a pretrained language model. Additionally, we construct an Object Reference Graph to capture structural features, drawing inspiration from program analysis. This dual approach enables us to analyze and detect PDF malware based on both semantic and structural features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed classifier achieves strong adversarial robustness while maintaining an exceptionally low false positive rate of only 0.07% on baseline dataset compared to state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten.

Existing approaches often rely on access to model internals or are constrained by static rules and token-level perturbations. Moreover, the idea of steering generative behavior via prompt-based instruction control remains largely underexplored. We introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures, including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning-based PDF malware classifiers have shown promise, these classifiers are often susceptible to adversarial attacks, undermining their reliability. To address this issue, recent studies have aimed to enhance the robustness of PDF classifiers. Despite these efforts, the feature engineering underlying these studies remains outdated. Consequently, even with the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, these approaches fail to fundamentally resolve the issue of feature instability. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for PDF feature extraction and PDF malware detection. We introduce the PDFObj IR (PDF Object Intermediate Representation), an assembly-like language framework for PDF objects, from which we extract semantic features using a pretrained language model. Additionally, we construct an Object Reference Graph to capture structural features, drawing inspiration from program analysis. This dual approach enables us to analyze and detect PDF malware based on both semantic and structural features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed classifier achieves strong adversarial robustness while maintaining an exceptionally low false positive rate of only 0.07% on baseline dataset compared to state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Better Language Model Inversion by Compactly Representing Next-Token Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17090v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method -- prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks in Collaborative Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00824v7)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint. To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables.

| **[SmartGuard: Leveraging Large Language Models for Network Attack Detection through Audit Log Analysis and Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16981v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-point monitoring solutions are widely deployed in today's enterprise environments to support advanced attack detection and investigation. These monitors continuously record system-level activities as audit logs and provide deep visibility into security events. Unfortunately, existing methods of semantic analysis based on audit logs have low granularity, only reaching the system call level, making it difficult to effectively classify highly covert behaviors. Additionally, existing works mainly match audit log streams with rule knowledge bases describing behaviors, which heavily rely on expertise and lack the ability to detect unknown attacks and provide interpretive descriptions. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an automated method that combines abstracted behaviors from audit event semantics with large language models. SmartGuard extracts specific behaviors (function level) from incoming system logs and constructs a knowledge graph, divides events by threads, and combines event summaries with graph embeddings to achieve information diagnosis and provide explanatory narratives through large language models. Our evaluation shows that SmartGuard achieves an average F1 score of 96\% in assessing malicious behaviors and demonstrates good scalability across multiple models and unknown attacks. It also possesses excellent fine-tuning capabilities, allowing experts to assist in timely system updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-AttacKG: A Multimodal Approach to Attack Graph Construction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16968v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) parsing aims to extract key threat information from massive data, transform it into actionable intelligence, enhance threat detection and defense efficiency, including attack graph construction, intelligence fusion and indicator extraction. Among these research topics, Attack Graph Construction (AGC) is essential for visualizing and understanding the potential attack paths of threat events from CTI reports. Existing approaches primarily construct the attack graphs purely from the textual data to reveal the logical threat relationships between entities within the attack behavioral sequence. However, they typically overlook the specific threat information inherent in visual modalities, which preserves the key threat details from inherently-multimodal CTI report. Therefore, we enhance the effectiveness of attack graph construction by analyzing visual information through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a novel framework, MM-AttacKG, which can effectively extract key information from threat images and integrate it into attack graph construction, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and accuracy of attack graphs. It first employs a threat image parsing module to extract critical threat information from images and generate descriptions using MLLMs. Subsequently, it builds an iterative question-answering pipeline tailored for image parsing to refine the understanding of threat images. Finally, it achieves content-level integration between attack graphs and image-based answers through MLLMs, completing threat information enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that MM-AttacKG can accurately identify key information in threat images and significantly improve the quality of multimodal attack graph construction, effectively addressing the shortcomings of existing methods in utilizing image-based threat information.</p></details> |  |
| **[PR-Attack: Coordinated Prompt-RAG Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models via Bilevel Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07717v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical sciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MIST: Jailbreaking Black-box Large Language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16792v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization. Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cross-Modal Obfuscation for Jailbreak Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16760v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency. In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO), a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs' cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced, alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
