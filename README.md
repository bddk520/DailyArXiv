Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/MU-Coreset.</p></details> |  |

| **[From Vulnerabilities to Remediation: A Systematic Literature Review of LLMs in Code Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15004v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ControlNET: A Firewall for RAG-based LLM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09593v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the factual accuracy and domain adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaSteer: Your Aligned LLM is Inherently an Adaptive Jailbreak Defender](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09466v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Activation steering offers a training-free defense method but relies on fixed steering coefficients, resulting in suboptimal protection and increased false rejections of benign inputs. To address this, we propose AdaSteer, an adaptive activation steering method that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics. We identify two key properties: Rejection Law (R-Law), which shows that stronger steering is needed for jailbreak inputs opposing the rejection direction, and Harmfulness Law (H-Law), which differentiates adversarial and benign inputs. AdaSteer steers input representations along both the Rejection Direction (RD) and Harmfulness Direction (HD), with adaptive coefficients learned via logistic regression, ensuring robust jailbreak defense while preserving benign input handling. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5 show that AdaSteer outperforms baseline methods across multiple jailbreak attacks with minimal impact on utility. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable model internals for real-time, flexible safety enforcement in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Our preliminary investigation reveals semantic overlap between jailbreak/harmful queries and normal prompts in embedding space, suggesting that more effective safety alignment requires a deeper semantic understanding. This motivates us to incorporate safety-policy-driven reasoning into the alignment process. To this end, we propose the Safety-oriented Reasoning Optimization Framework (SaRO), which consists of two stages: (1) Reasoning-style Warmup (RW) that enables LLMs to internalize long-chain reasoning through supervised fine-tuning, and (2) Safety-oriented Reasoning Process Optimization (SRPO) that promotes safety reflection via direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SaRO over traditional alignment methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the attack success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02406v3)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution. We answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts. We prove that our tests' type I and type II errors decrease exponentially as text length increases. For designing our tests for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by the evaluator model $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in the string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. For our experiments: First, we present experiments using open-source LLMs to support our theoretical results, and then we provide experiments in a black-box setting with adversarial attacks. Practically, our work enables guaranteed finding of the origin of harmful or false LLM-generated text, which can be useful for combating misinformation and compliance with emerging AI regulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCP Safety Audit: LLMs with the Model Context Protocol Allow Major Security Exploits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reduce development overhead and enable seamless integration between potential components comprising any given generative AI application, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) has recently been released and subsequently widely adopted. The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API calls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By connecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources, and prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs. However, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security risks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs may be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system through various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access control, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related attacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first agentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses several agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP server's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and remediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report detailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with general-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to audit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment. The described MCP server auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, is freely available at: https://github.com/johnhalloran321/mcpSafetyScanner</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 21 figures, and 2 Tables.

| **[Using Large Language Models for Template Detection from Security Event Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05045v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern IT systems and computer networks, real-time and offline event log analysis is a crucial part of cyber security monitoring. In particular, event log analysis techniques are essential for the timely detection of cyber attacks and for assisting security experts with the analysis of past security incidents. The detection of line patterns or templates from unstructured textual event logs has been identified as an important task of event log analysis since detected templates represent event types in the event log and prepare the logs for downstream online or offline security monitoring tasks. During the last two decades, a number of template mining algorithms have been proposed. However, many proposed algorithms rely on traditional data mining techniques, and the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has received less attention so far. Also, most approaches that harness LLMs are supervised, and unsupervised LLM-based template mining remains an understudied area. The current paper addresses this research gap and investigates the application of LLMs for unsupervised detection of templates from unstructured security event logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Journal of Information Security</p></details> |
| **[SnatchML: Hijacking ML models without Training Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01708v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model hijacking can cause significant accountability and security risks since the owner of a hijacked model can be framed for having their model offer illegal or unethical services. Prior works consider model hijacking as a training time attack, whereby an adversary requires full access to the ML model training. In this paper, we consider a stronger threat model for an inference-time hijacking attack, where the adversary has no access to the training phase of the victim model. Our intuition is that ML models, which are typically over-parameterized, might have the capacity to (unintentionally) learn more than the intended task they are trained for. We propose SnatchML, a new training-free model hijacking attack, that leverages the extra capacity learnt by the victim model to infer different tasks that can be semantically related or unrelated to the original one. Our results on models deployed on AWS Sagemaker showed that SnatchML can deliver high accuracy on hijacking tasks. Interestingly, while all previous approaches are limited by the number of classes in the benign task, SnatchML can hijack models for tasks that contain more classes than the original. We explore different methods to mitigate this risk; We propose meta-unlearning, which is designed to help the model unlearn a potentially malicious task while training for the original task. We also provide insights on over-parametrization as a possible inherent factor that facilitates model hijacking, and accordingly, we propose a compression-based countermeasure to counteract this attack. We believe this work offers a previously overlooked perspective on model hijacking attacks, presenting a stronger threat model and higher applicability in real-world contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Do We Really Need Curated Malicious Data for Safety Alignment in Multi-modal Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10000v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress, yet their safety alignment remains limited. Typically, current open-source MLLMs rely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful generations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for multi-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to vision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize a carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while the specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset remain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap primarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response quality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution to boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the key factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small set of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear rejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for labor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can still be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection data exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not lost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction finetuning. Simply correcting the underlying data bias could narrow the safety gap in the vision domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, codes in process</p></details> |

However, retrieved documents may contain sensitive knowledge, posing risks of privacy leakage in generative results. Thus, effectively erasing private information from retrieved documents is a key challenge for RAG. Unlike traditional text anonymization, RAG should consider: (1) the inherent multi-document reasoning may face de-anonymization attacks; (2) private knowledge varies by scenarios, so users should be allowed to customize which information to erase; (3) preserving sufficient publicly available knowledge for generation tasks. This paper introduces the privacy erasure task for RAG and proposes Eraser4RAG, a private knowledge eraser which effectively removes user-defined private knowledge from documents while preserving sufficient public knowledge for generation. Specifically, we first construct a global knowledge graph to identify potential knowledge across documents, aiming to defend against de-anonymization attacks. Then we randomly split it into private and public sub-graphs, and fine-tune Flan-T5 to rewrite the retrieved documents excluding private triples. Finally, PPO algorithm optimizes the rewriting model to minimize private triples and maximize public triples retention. Experiments on four QA datasets demonstrate that Eraser4RAG achieves superior erase performance than GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs are observed to be vulnerable against prompt injection attacks from external data sources, tabular agents impose strict data formats and predefined rules on the attacker's payload, which are ineffective unless the agent navigates multiple layers of structural data to incorporate the payload. To address the challenge, we present a novel attack termed StruPhantom which specifically targets black-box LLM-powered tabular agents. Our attack designs an evolutionary optimization procedure which continually refines attack payloads via the proposed constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search augmented by an off-topic evaluator. StruPhantom helps systematically explore and exploit the weaknesses of target applications to achieve goal hijacking. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of StruPhantom across various LLM-based agents, including those on real-world platforms, and attack scenarios. Our attack achieves over 50% higher success rates than baselines in enforcing the application's response to contain phishing links or malicious codes.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

Traditional spam detection methods, including rules-based, collaborative, and machine learning approaches, struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving tactics employed by spammers. This project studies new spam detection systems that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with spam datasets. More importantly, we want to understand how LLM-based spam detection systems perform under adversarial attacks that purposefully modify spam emails and data poisoning attacks that exploit the differences between the training data and the massages in detection, to which traditional machine learning models are shown to be vulnerable. This experimentation employs two LLM models of GPT2 and BERT and three spam datasets of Enron, LingSpam, and SMSspamCollection for extensive training and testing tasks. The results show that, while they can function as effective spam filters, the LLM models are susceptible to the adversarial and data poisoning attacks.

Effective adversarial examples, therefore, offer the potential to train more robust models by eliminating model singularities. We propose NODE-AdvGAN, a novel approach that treats adversarial generation as a continuous process and employs a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to simulate generator dynamics. By mimicking the iterative nature of traditional gradient-based methods, NODE-AdvGAN generates smoother and more precise perturbations that preserve high perceptual similarity when added to benign images. We also propose a new training strategy, NODE-AdvGAN-T, which enhances transferability in black-box attacks by tuning the noise parameters during training.

| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the attack success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Instruction Fine-tuning Attack on Language Models with Influence Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09026v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction fine-tuning attacks pose a significant threat to large language models (LLMs) by subtly embedding poisoned data in fine-tuning datasets, which can trigger harmful or unintended responses across a range of tasks. This undermines model alignment and poses security risks in real-world deployment. In this work, we present a simple and effective approach to detect and mitigate such attacks using influence functions, a classical statistical tool adapted for machine learning interpretation. Traditionally, the high computational costs of influence functions have limited their application to large models and datasets. The recent Eigenvalue-Corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation method enables efficient influence score computation, making it feasible for large-scale analysis. We are the first to apply influence functions for detecting language model instruction fine-tuning attacks on large-scale datasets, as both the instruction fine-tuning attack on language models and the influence calculation approximation technique are relatively new. Our large-scale empirical evaluation of influence functions on 50,000 fine-tuning examples and 32 tasks reveals a strong association between influence scores and sentiment. Building on this, we introduce a novel sentiment transformation combined with influence functions to detect and remove critical poisons -- poisoned data points that skew model predictions. Removing these poisons (only 1% of total data) recovers model performance to near-clean levels, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

| **[Robust Steganography from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08977v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent steganographic schemes, starting with Meteor (CCS'21), rely on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to resolve a historically-challenging task of disguising covert communication as ``innocent-looking'' natural-language communication. However, existing methods are vulnerable to ``re-randomization attacks,'' where slight changes to the communicated text, that might go unnoticed, completely destroy any hidden message. This is also a vulnerability in more traditional encryption-based stegosystems, where adversaries can modify the randomness of an encryption scheme to destroy the hidden message while preserving an acceptable covertext to ordinary users. In this work, we study the problem of robust steganography. We introduce formal definitions of weak and strong robust LLM-based steganography, corresponding to two threat models in which natural language serves as a covertext channel resistant to realistic re-randomization attacks. We then propose two constructions satisfying these notions. We design and implement our steganographic schemes that embed arbitrary secret messages into natural language text generated by LLMs, ensuring recoverability even under adversarial paraphrasing and rewording attacks. To support further research and real-world deployment, we release our implementation and datasets for public use.</p></details> | 36 pages, 9 figures |

In particular, event log analysis techniques are essential for the timely detection of cyber attacks and for assisting security experts with the analysis of past security incidents. The detection of line patterns or templates from unstructured textual event logs has been identified as an important task of event log analysis since detected templates represent event types in the event log and prepare the logs for downstream online or offline security monitoring tasks. During the last two decades, a number of template mining algorithms have been proposed. However, many proposed algorithms rely on traditional data mining techniques, and the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has received less attention so far. Also, most approaches that harness LLMs are supervised, and unsupervised LLM-based template mining remains an understudied area. The current paper addresses this research gap and investigates the application of LLMs for unsupervised detection of templates from unstructured security event logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Journal of Information Security</p></details> |

Prior works consider model hijacking as a training time attack, whereby an adversary requires full access to the ML model training. In this paper, we consider a stronger threat model for an inference-time hijacking attack, where the adversary has no access to the training phase of the victim model. Our intuition is that ML models, which are typically over-parameterized, might have the capacity to (unintentionally) learn more than the intended task they are trained for. We propose SnatchML, a new training-free model hijacking attack, that leverages the extra capacity learnt by the victim model to infer different tasks that can be semantically related or unrelated to the original one. Our results on models deployed on AWS Sagemaker showed that SnatchML can deliver high accuracy on hijacking tasks. Interestingly, while all previous approaches are limited by the number of classes in the benign task, SnatchML can hijack models for tasks that contain more classes than the original. We explore different methods to mitigate this risk; We propose meta-unlearning, which is designed to help the model unlearn a potentially malicious task while training for the original task. We also provide insights on over-parametrization as a possible inherent factor that facilitates model hijacking, and accordingly, we propose a compression-based countermeasure to counteract this attack. We believe this work offers a previously overlooked perspective on model hijacking attacks, presenting a stronger threat model and higher applicability in real-world contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.
