This fragmentation makes reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible research in LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Measuring the Security of Mobile LLM Agents under Adversarial Prompts from Untrusted Third-Party Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27140v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development, enabling AI-powered applications known as LLM-based agents that promise to automate tasks across diverse apps and workflows. Yet, the security implications of deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation. Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications) are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let the Bees Find the Weak Spots: A Path Planning Perspective on Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks against LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03271v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's robustness. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Shukti042/AdversarialExample.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2025 (camera-ready)</p></details> |
| **[Do Methods to Jailbreak and Defend LLMs Generalize Across Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00689v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment after training and tuning, yet recent work shows that safety can be bypassed through jailbreak attacks. While many jailbreaks and defenses exist, their cross-lingual generalization remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic multilingual evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages -- spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource languages -- using six LLMs on HarmBench and AdvBench. We assess two jailbreak types: logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based. For both types, attack success and defense robustness vary across languages: high-resource languages are safer under standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones. Simple defenses can be effective, but are language- and model-dependent. These findings call for language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On The Dangers of Poisoned LLMs In Security Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02600v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates some of the risks introduced by "LLM poisoning," the intentional or unintentional introduction of malicious or biased data during model training. We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a limited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple LLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes the introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we demonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently dismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we propose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness, robustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v5)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation to system-level compromises. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs security used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving computer takeovers. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection, and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealthy and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed that LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor attacks will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. We found that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks, and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Automated Framework for Strategy Discovery, Retrieval, and Evolution in LLM Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02356v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting, and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scam Shield: Multi-Model Voting and Fine-Tuned LLMs Against Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01746v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scam detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity as adversaries craft messages that evade automated filters. We propose a Hierarchical Scam Detection System (HSDS) that combines a lightweight multi-model voting front end with a fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct back end to improve accuracy and robustness against adversarial attacks. An ensemble of four classifiers provides preliminary predictions through majority vote, and ambiguous cases are escalated to the fine-tuned model, which is optimized with adversarial training to reduce misclassification. Experiments show that this hierarchical design both improves adversarial scam detection and shortens inference time by routing most cases away from the LLM, outperforming traditional machine-learning baselines and proprietary LLM baselines. The findings highlight the effectiveness of a hybrid voting mechanism and adversarial fine-tuning in fortifying LLMs against evolving scam tactics, enhancing the resilience of automated scam detection systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[A New Probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure Model for Self-Protecting Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04523v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system. Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component. Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the behavior of the system under such assumptions.</p></details> |  |

The main issue discussed in this paper is how traditional rule-based and signature based security systems are not enough to deal with modern AI powered cyber threats. Cybersecurity industry is changing as threats are becoming more dangerous and adaptive in nature by levering the features provided by AI tools. By integrating LLMs into these tools and protocols, make the systems scalable, context-aware and intelligent. Thus helping it to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. The paper studies the architecture and functioning of LLMs, its integration into Encrypted prompts to prevent prompt injection attacks. It also studies the integration of LLMs into cybersecurity tools using a four layered architecture. At last, the paper has tried to explain various ways of integration LLMs into traditional Intrusion Detection System and enhancing its original abilities in various dimensions. The key findings of this paper has been (i)Encrypted Prompt with LLM is an effective way to mitigate prompt injection attacks, (ii) LLM enhanced cyber security tools are more accurate, scalable and adaptable to new threats as compared to traditional models, (iii) The decoupled model approach for LLM integration into IDS is the best way as it is the most accurate way.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v4)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> |

Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Whisper Leak: a side-channel attack on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03675v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like "money laundering" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Manipulation Facing Threats: Evaluating Physical Vulnerabilities in End-to-End Vision Language Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13174v4)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel framework of MOR via Lie groups, called MORLie, in which high-dimensional dynamical systems on manifolds are approximated by low-dimensional dynamical systems on Lie groups. In comparison to other Lie group methods we are able to attack non-equivariant dynamics, which are frequent in practical applications, and we provide new non-intrusive MOR methods based on the presented geometric formulation. We also highlight numerically that MORLie has a lower error bound than the Kolmogorov $N$-width, which limits linear-subspace methods. The method is applied to various examples: 1. MOR of a simplified deforming body modeled by a noisy point cloud data following a sheering motion, where MORLie outperforms a naive POD approach in terms of accuracy and dimensionality reduction. 2. Reconstructing liver motion during respiration with data from edge detection in ultrasound scans, where MORLie reaches performance approaching the state of the art, while reducing the training time from hours on a computing cluster to minutes on a mobile workstation. 3. An analytic example showing that the method of freezing is analytically recovered as a special case, showing the generality of the geometric framework.</p></details> | 22 pages, 21 figures |

In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding).

We tested the safety and security postures of eight open-weight large language models (LLMs) to identify vulnerabilities that may impact subsequent fine-tuning and deployment. Using automated adversarial testing, we measured each model's resilience against single-turn and multi-turn prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Our findings reveal pervasive vulnerabilities across all tested models, with multi-turn attacks achieving success rates between 25.86\% and 92.78\% -- representing a $2\times$ to $10\times$ increase over single-turn baselines. These results underscore a systemic inability of current open-weight models to maintain safety guardrails across extended interactions. We assess that alignment strategies and lab priorities significantly influence resilience: capability-focused models such as Llama 3.3 and Qwen 3 demonstrate higher multi-turn susceptibility, whereas safety-oriented designs such as Google Gemma 3 exhibit more balanced performance. The analysis concludes that open-weight models, while crucial for innovation, pose tangible operational and ethical risks when deployed without layered security controls. These findings are intended to inform practitioners and developers of the potential risks and the value of professional AI security solutions to mitigate exposure. Addressing multi-turn vulnerabilities is essential to ensure the safe, reliable, and responsible deployment of open-weight LLMs in enterprise and public domains. We recommend adopting a security-first design philosophy and layered protections to ensure resilient deployments of open-weight models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the first systematic study of the Bayesian advantage in re-identifying a user's message under the shuffle model. We begin with a basic setting: one sample is drawn from a distribution $P$, and $n - 1$ samples are drawn from a distribution $Q$, after which all $n$ samples are randomly shuffled. We define $\beta_n(P, Q)$ as the success probability of a Bayes-optimal adversary in identifying the sample from $P$, and define the additive and multiplicative Bayesian advantages as $\mathsf{Adv}_n^{+}(P, Q) = \beta_n(P,Q) - \frac{1}{n}$ and $\mathsf{Adv}_n^{\times}(P, Q) = n \cdot \beta_n(P,Q)$, respectively. We derive exact analytical expressions and asymptotic characterizations of $\beta_n(P, Q)$, along with evaluations in several representative scenarios. Furthermore, we establish (nearly) tight mutual bounds between the additive Bayesian advantage and the total variation distance. Finally, we extend our analysis beyond the basic setting and present, for the first time, an upper bound on the success probability of Bayesian attacks in shuffle differential privacy. Specifically, when the outputs of $n$ users -- each processed through an $\varepsilon$-differentially private local randomizer -- are shuffled, the probability that an attacker successfully re-identifies any target user's message is at most $e^{\varepsilon}/n$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CSF 2026 -- 39th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium</p></details> |

| **[A New Probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure Model for Self-Protecting Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04523v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system. Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component. Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the behavior of the system under such assumptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Cyber Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04508v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the integration off Large Language Models into cybersecurity tools and protocols. The main issue discussed in this paper is how traditional rule-based and signature based security systems are not enough to deal with modern AI powered cyber threats. Cybersecurity industry is changing as threats are becoming more dangerous and adaptive in nature by levering the features provided by AI tools. By integrating LLMs into these tools and protocols, make the systems scalable, context-aware and intelligent. Thus helping it to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. The paper studies the architecture and functioning of LLMs, its integration into Encrypted prompts to prevent prompt injection attacks. It also studies the integration of LLMs into cybersecurity tools using a four layered architecture. At last, the paper has tried to explain various ways of integration LLMs into traditional Intrusion Detection System and enhancing its original abilities in various dimensions. The key findings of this paper has been (i)Encrypted Prompt with LLM is an effective way to mitigate prompt injection attacks, (ii) LLM enhanced cyber security tools are more accurate, scalable and adaptable to new threats as compared to traditional models, (iii) The decoupled model approach for LLM integration into IDS is the best way as it is the most accurate way.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704v4)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://youngwanlee.github.io/holisafe</p></details> |
| **[VERA: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22666v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Whisper Leak: a side-channel attack on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03675v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like "money laundering" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
