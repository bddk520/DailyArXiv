| **["Are You Sure?": An Empirical Study of Human Perception Vulnerability in LLM-Driven Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21127v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are rapidly becoming trusted copilots in high-stakes domains like software development and healthcare. However, this deepening trust introduces a novel attack surface: Agent-Mediated Deception (AMD), where compromised agents are weaponized against their human users. While extensive research focuses on agent-centric threats, human susceptibility to deception by a compromised agent remains unexplored. We present the first large-scale empirical study with 303 participants to measure human susceptibility to AMD. This is based on HAT-Lab (Human-Agent Trust Laboratory), a high-fidelity research platform we develop, featuring nine carefully crafted scenarios spanning everyday and professional domains (e.g., healthcare, software development, human resources). Our 10 key findings reveal significant vulnerabilities and provide future defense perspectives. Specifically, only 8.6% of participants perceive AMD attacks, while domain experts show increased susceptibility in certain scenarios. We identify six cognitive failure modes in users and find that their risk awareness often fails to translate to protective behavior. The defense analysis reveals that effective warnings should interrupt workflows with low verification costs. With experiential learning based on HAT-Lab, over 90% of users who perceive risks report increased caution against AMD. This work provides empirical evidence and a platform for human-centric agent security research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple and Efficient Jailbreak Method Exploiting LLMs' Helpfulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14297v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study reveals a critical safety blind spot in modern LLMs: learning-style queries, which closely resemble ordinary educational questions, can reliably elicit harmful responses. The learning-style queries are constructed by a novel reframing paradigm: HILL (Hiding Intention by Learning from LLMs). The deterministic, model-agnostic reframing framework is composed of 4 conceptual components: 1) key concept, 2) exploratory transformation, 3) detail-oriented inquiry, and optionally 4) hypotheticality. Further, new metrics are introduced to thoroughly evaluate the efficiency and harmfulness of jailbreak methods. Experiments on the AdvBench dataset across a wide range of models demonstrate HILL's strong generalizability. It achieves top attack success rates on the majority of models and across malicious categories while maintaining high efficiency with concise prompts. On the other hand, results of various defense methods show the robustness of HILL, with most defenses having mediocre effects or even increasing the attack success rates. In addition, the assessment of defenses on the constructed safe prompts reveals inherent limitations of LLMs' safety mechanisms and flaws in the defense methods. This work exposes significant vulnerabilities of safety measures against learning-style elicitation, highlighting a critical challenge of fulfilling both helpfulness and safety alignments.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdapTools: Adaptive Tool-based Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks on Agentic LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20720v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of external data services (e.g., Model Context Protocol, MCP) has made large language model-based agents increasingly powerful for complex task execution. However, this advancement introduces critical security vulnerabilities, particularly indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Existing attack methods are limited by their reliance on static patterns and evaluation on simple language models, failing to address the fast-evolving nature of modern AI agents. We introduce AdapTools, a novel adaptive IPI attack framework that selects stealthier attack tools and generates adaptive attack prompts to create a rigorous security evaluation environment. Our approach comprises two key components: (1) Adaptive Attack Strategy Construction, which develops transferable adversarial strategies for prompt optimization, and (2) Attack Enhancement, which identifies stealthy tools capable of circumventing task-relevance defenses. Comprehensive experimental evaluation shows that AdapTools achieves a 2.13 times improvement in attack success rate while degrading system utility by a factor of 1.78. Notably, the framework maintains its effectiveness even against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Our method advances the understanding of IPI attacks and provides a useful reference for future research.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Breaking Agent Backbones: Evaluating the Security of Backbone LLMs in AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22620v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being deployed at scale, yet we lack a systematic understanding of how the choice of backbone LLM affects agent security. The non-deterministic sequential nature of AI agents complicates security modeling, while the integration of traditional software with AI components entangles novel LLM vulnerabilities with conventional security risks. Existing frameworks only partially address these challenges as they either capture specific vulnerabilities only or require modeling of complete agents. To address these limitations, we introduce threat snapshots: a framework that isolates specific states in an agent's execution flow where LLM vulnerabilities manifest, enabling the systematic identification and categorization of security risks that propagate from the LLM to the agent level. We apply this framework to construct the $b^3$ benchmark, a security benchmark based on 194,331 unique crowdsourced adversarial attacks. We then evaluate 34 popular LLMs with it, revealing, among other insights, that enhanced reasoning capabilities improve security, while model size does not correlate with security. We release our benchmark, dataset, and evaluation code to facilitate widespread adoption by LLM providers and practitioners, offering guidance for agent developers and incentivizing model developers to prioritize backbone security improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Julia...</summary><p>Julia Bazinska and Max Mathys contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[OptiLeak: Efficient Prompt Reconstruction via Reinforcement Learning in Multi-tenant LLM Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20595v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-tenant LLM serving frameworks widely adopt shared Key-Value caches to enhance efficiency. However, this creates side-channel vulnerabilities enabling prompt leakage attacks. Prior studies identified these attack surfaces yet focused on expanding attack vectors rather than optimizing attack performance, reporting impractically high attack costs that underestimate the true privacy risk. We propose OptiLeak, a reinforcement learning-enhanced framework that maximizes prompt reconstruction efficiency through two-stage fine-tuning. Our key insight is that domain-specific ``hard tokens'' -- terms difficult to predict yet carrying sensitive information -- can be automatically identified via likelihood ranking and used to construct preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization, eliminating manual annotation. This enables effective preference alignment while avoiding the overfitting issues of extended supervised fine-tuning. Evaluated on three benchmarks spanning medical and financial domains, OptiLeak achieves up to $12.48\times$ reduction in average requests per token compared to baseline approaches, with consistent improvements across model scales from 3B to 14B parameters. Our findings demonstrate that cache-based prompt leakage poses a more severe threat than previously reported, underscoring the need for robust cache isolation in production deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[MalTool: Malicious Tool Attacks on LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12194v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a malicious tool attack, an attacker uploads a malicious tool to a distribution platform; once a user installs the tool and the LLM agent selects it during task execution, the tool can compromise the user's security and privacy. Prior work primarily focuses on manipulating tool names and descriptions to increase the likelihood of installation by users and selection by LLM agents. However, a successful attack also requires embedding malicious behaviors in the tool's code implementation, which remains largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first systematic study of malicious tool code implementations. We first propose a taxonomy of malicious tool behaviors based on the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad, tailored to LLM-agent settings. To investigate the severity of the risks posed by attackers exploiting coding LLMs to automatically generate malicious tools, we develop MalTool, a coding-LLM-based framework that synthesizes tools exhibiting specified malicious behaviors, either as standalone tools or embedded within otherwise benign implementations. To ensure functional correctness and structural diversity, MalTool leverages an automated verifier that validates whether generated tools exhibit the intended malicious behaviors and differ sufficiently from prior instances, iteratively refining generations until success. Our evaluation demonstrates that MalTool is highly effective even when coding LLMs are safety-aligned. Using MalTool, we construct two datasets of malicious tools: 1,200 standalone malicious tools and 5,287 real-world tools with embedded malicious behaviors. We further show that existing detection methods, including commercial malware detection approaches such as VirusTotal and methods tailored to the LLM-agent setting, exhibit limited effectiveness at detecting the malicious tools, highlighting an urgent need for new defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[BarrierSteer: LLM Safety via Learning Barrier Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20102v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the state-of-the-art performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation remains a major obstacle to deployment, particularly in high-stakes settings. Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper introduces SafeBarrier, a framework that enforces safety in large language models by steering their latent representations with control barrier functions during inference, reducing adversarial and unsafe outputs</p></details> |
| **[AttestLLM: Efficient Attestation Framework for Billion-scale On-device LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06326v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness, verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical. Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen, and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery attacks.</p></details> | accept to DAC 2026 |
| **[LLM-enabled Applications Require System-Level Threat Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19844v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-enabled applications are rapidly reshaping the software ecosystem by using large language models as core reasoning components for complex task execution. This paradigm shift, however, introduces fundamentally new reliability challenges and significantly expands the security attack surface, due to the non-deterministic, learning-driven, and difficult-to-verify nature of LLM behavior. In light of these emerging and unavoidable safety challenges, we argue that such risks should be treated as expected operational conditions rather than exceptional events, necessitating a dedicated incident-response perspective. Consequently, the primary barrier to trustworthy deployment is not further improving model capability but establishing system-level threat monitoring mechanisms that can detect and contextualize security-relevant anomalies after deployment -- an aspect largely underexplored beyond testing or guardrail-based defenses. Accordingly, this position paper advocates systematic and comprehensive monitoring of security threats in LLM-enabled applications as a prerequisite for reliable operation and a foundation for dedicated incident-response frameworks.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[DITTO: A Spoofing Attack Framework on Watermarked LLMs via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10987v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation, to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning, from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from expertly imitated ones.

However, this capability also introduces a previously overlooked risk: adversaries may exploit visual instructions to inject malicious intent through the image modality. In this work, we uncover this risk by proposing Visual Instruction Injection (VII), a training-free and transferable jailbreaking framework that intentionally disguises the malicious intent of unsafe text prompts as benign visual instructions in the safe reference image. Specifically, VII coordinates a Malicious Intent Reprogramming module to distill malicious intent from unsafe text prompts while minimizing their static harmfulness, and a Visual Instruction Grounding module to ground the distilled intent onto a safe input image by rendering visual instructions that preserve semantic consistency with the original unsafe text prompt, thereby inducing harmful content during I2V generation. Empirically, our extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art commercial I2V models (Kling-v2.5-turbo, Gemini Veo-3.1, Seedance-1.5-pro, and PixVerse-V5) demonstrate that VII achieves Attack Success Rates of up to 83.5% while reducing Refusal Rates to near zero, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://Zbwwwwwwww.github.io/VII</p></details> |

Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review for KDD 2026 (Applied Data Science)</p></details> |

This openness introduces a security misalignment: agents implicitly trust tools exposed by potentially untrusted MCP servers. However, despite its excellent utility, existing agents typically offer limited validation for third-party MCP servers. As a result, agents remain vulnerable to MCP-based attacks that exploit the misalignment between agents and servers throughout the tool invocation lifecycle. In this paper, we propose MCPShield as a plug-in security cognition layer that mitigates this misalignment and ensures agent security when invoking MCP-based tools. Drawing inspiration from human experience-driven tool validation, MCPShield assists agent forms security cognition with metadata-guided probing before invocation. Our method constrains execution within controlled boundaries while cognizing runtime events, and subsequently updates security cognition by reasoning over historical traces after invocation, building on human post-use reflection on tool behavior. Experiments demonstrate that MCPShield exhibits strong generalization in defending against six novel MCP-based attack scenarios across six widely used agentic LLMs, while avoiding false positives on benign servers and incurring low deployment overhead.

However, such services are highly vulnerable to Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs), where an adversary repeatedly queries a target model to collect input-output pairs and uses them to train a surrogate model that closely replicates its functionality. While numerous defense strategies have been proposed, verifying the ownership of a suspicious model with strict theoretical guarantees remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce CREDIT, a certified ownership verification against MEAs. Specifically, we employ mutual information to quantify the similarity between DNN models, propose a practical verification threshold, and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for ownership verification based on this threshold. We extensively evaluate our approach on several mainstream datasets across different domains and tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/LabRAI/CREDIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITED: A Decision Boundary-Aware Signature for GNNs Towards Model Extraction Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20418v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in various applications, such as recommendation systems and financial risk management. However, deploying large-scale GNN models locally is particularly challenging for users, as it requires significant computational resources and extensive property data. Consequently, Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has become increasingly popular, offering a convenient way to deploy and access various models, including GNNs. However, an emerging threat known as Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs) presents significant risks, as adversaries can readily obtain surrogate GNN models exhibiting similar functionality. Specifically, attackers repeatedly query the target model using subgraph inputs to collect corresponding responses. These input-output pairs are subsequently utilized to train their own surrogate models at minimal cost. Many techniques have been proposed to defend against MEAs, but most are limited to specific output levels (e.g., embedding or label) and suffer from inherent technical drawbacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ownership verification framework CITED which is a first-of-its-kind method to achieve ownership verification on both embedding and label levels. Moreover, CITED is a novel signature-based method that neither harms downstream performance nor introduces auxiliary models that reduce efficiency, while still outperforming all watermarking and fingerprinting approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our CITED framework. Code is available at: https://github.com/LabRAI/CITED.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafePickle: Robust and Generic ML Detection of Malicious Pickle-based ML Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19818v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model repositories such as Hugging Face increasingly distribute machine learning artifacts serialized with Python's pickle format, exposing users to remote code execution (RCE) risks during model loading. Recent defenses, such as PickleBall, rely on per-library policy synthesis that requires complex system setups and verified benign models, which limits scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose a lightweight, machine-learning-based scanner that detects malicious Pickle-based files without policy generation or code instrumentation. Our approach statically extracts structural and semantic features from Pickle bytecode and applies supervised and unsupervised models to classify files as benign or malicious. We construct and release a labeled dataset of 727 Pickle-based files from Hugging Face and evaluate our models on four datasets: our own, PickleBall (out-of-distribution), Hide-and-Seek (9 advanced evasive malicious models), and synthetic joblib files. Our method achieves 90.01% F1-score compared with 7.23%-62.75% achieved by the SOTA scanners (Modelscan, Fickling, ClamAV, VirusTotal) on our dataset. Furthermore, on the PickleBall data (OOD), it achieves 81.22% F1-score compared with 76.09% achieved by the PickleBall method, while remaining fully library-agnostic. Finally, we show that our method is the only one to correctly parse and classify 9/9 evasive Hide-and-Seek malicious models specially crafted to evade scanners. This demonstrates that data-driven detection can effectively and generically mitigate Pickle-based model file attacks.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However, the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2026 |

Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs and overestimating robustness. We show that for the goal of eliciting harmful responses, repeated sampling of model outputs during the attack complements prompt optimization and serves as a strong and efficient attack vector. By casting attacks as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we empirically determine compute-optimal trade-offs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts success rates by up to 37\% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. We further analyze how distributions of output harmfulness evolve during an adversarial attack, discovering that many common optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a label-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy maximization, demonstrating how our sampling-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings establish the importance of sampling in attacks to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety at scale.</p></details> |  |

However, this capability also introduces a previously overlooked risk: adversaries may exploit visual instructions to inject malicious intent through the image modality. In this work, we uncover this risk by proposing Visual Instruction Injection (VII), a training-free and transferable jailbreaking framework that intentionally disguises the malicious intent of unsafe text prompts as benign visual instructions in the safe reference image. Specifically, VII coordinates a Malicious Intent Reprogramming module to distill malicious intent from unsafe text prompts while minimizing their static harmfulness, and a Visual Instruction Grounding module to ground the distilled intent onto a safe input image by rendering visual instructions that preserve semantic consistency with the original unsafe text prompt, thereby inducing harmful content during I2V generation. Empirically, our extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art commercial I2V models (Kling-v2.5-turbo, Gemini Veo-3.1, Seedance-1.5-pro, and PixVerse-V5) demonstrate that VII achieves Attack Success Rates of up to 83.5% while reducing Refusal Rates to near zero, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://Zbwwwwwwww.github.io/VII</p></details> |

Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review for KDD 2026 (Applied Data Science)</p></details> |

This openness introduces a security misalignment: agents implicitly trust tools exposed by potentially untrusted MCP servers. However, despite its excellent utility, existing agents typically offer limited validation for third-party MCP servers. As a result, agents remain vulnerable to MCP-based attacks that exploit the misalignment between agents and servers throughout the tool invocation lifecycle. In this paper, we propose MCPShield as a plug-in security cognition layer that mitigates this misalignment and ensures agent security when invoking MCP-based tools. Drawing inspiration from human experience-driven tool validation, MCPShield assists agent forms security cognition with metadata-guided probing before invocation. Our method constrains execution within controlled boundaries while cognizing runtime events, and subsequently updates security cognition by reasoning over historical traces after invocation, building on human post-use reflection on tool behavior. Experiments demonstrate that MCPShield exhibits strong generalization in defending against six novel MCP-based attack scenarios across six widely used agentic LLMs, while avoiding false positives on benign servers and incurring low deployment overhead. Overall, our work provides a practical and robust security safeguard for MCP-based tool invocation in open agent ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
