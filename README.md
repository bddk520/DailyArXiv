| **[MrGuard: A Multilingual Reasoning Guardrail for Universal LLM Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15241v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks such as jailbreaking, which can elicit harmful or unsafe behaviors. This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Breaking Bad Tokens: Detoxification of LLMs Using Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14536v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications, yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity, vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint: 19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Is Your Prompt Safe? Investigating Prompt Injection Attacks Against Open-Source LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14368v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks. Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response, reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models, including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over $60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, EMNLP 2025 under review</p></details> |
| **[Unlearning Backdoor Attacks for LLMs with Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14425v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and downstream tasks. However, PEFT has been proven vulnerable to malicious attacks. Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three state-of-the-art large language models and several different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs through Intent Concealment and Diversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14316v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, their security remains a pressing concern. One major threat is jailbreak attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2) poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content. To tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions: (1) ICE, a novel black-box jailbreak method that employs Intent Concealment and divErsion to effectively circumvent security constraints. ICE achieves high attack success rates (ASR) with a single query, significantly improving efficiency and transferability across different models. (2) BiSceneEval, a comprehensive dataset designed for assessing LLM robustness in question-answering and text-generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ICE outperforms existing jailbreak techniques, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms. Our findings underscore the necessity of a hybrid security strategy that integrates predefined security mechanisms with real-time semantic decomposition to enhance the security of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks for Flexible Control of Speech-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14286v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal, adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance to adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[IP Leakage Attacks Targeting LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12442v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent. Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts, MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components, including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **["Haet Bhasha aur Diskrimineshun": Phonetic Perturbations in Code-Mixed Hinglish to Red-Team LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14226v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and 95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing the Effects of Quantization on Trojans in Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14200v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models of code exhibit high capability in performing diverse software engineering tasks, such as code translation, defect detection, text-to-code generation, and code summarization. While their ability to enhance developer productivity has spurred widespread use, these models have also seen substantial growth in size, often reaching billions of parameters. This scale demands efficient memory resource usage, prompting practitioners to use optimization techniques such as model quantization. Quantization uses smaller bit representations for the model parameters, reducing the precision of the weights. In this work, we investigate the impact of quantization on the risk of data poisoning attacks on these models, specifically examining whether it mitigates or exacerbates such vulnerabilities. We focus on two large language models, Meta's Llama-2-7b and CodeLlama-7b, applied to an SQL code generation task. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for measuring trojan signals in compromised models. We find that quantization has differing effects on code-generating LLMs: while reducing precision does not significantly alter Llama-2's behavior, it boosts performance and reduces attack success rates in CodeLlama, particularly at 4-bit precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the efficacy of LLM Safety Solutions : The Palit Benchmark Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13028v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party. While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source), but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model (ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more representative performance metrics.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and 2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using our unsupervised ensemble approach.</p></details> |  |

We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space$\unicode{x2013}$the stylistic feature space$\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization, and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions become distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a metric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated distributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples become available. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to avoid reliance on machine-text detection.</p></details> |  |

In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, and resistance to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks. The persistent tension between the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[SifterNet: A Generalized and Model-Agnostic Trigger Purification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14531v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at resisting backdoor attacks in convolution neural networks and vision Transformer-based large model, this paper proposes a generalized and model-agnostic trigger-purification approach resorting to the classic Ising model. To date, existing trigger detection/removal studies usually require to know the detailed knowledge of target model in advance, access to a large number of clean samples or even model-retraining authorization, which brings the huge inconvenience for practical applications, especially inaccessible to target model. An ideal countermeasure ought to eliminate the implanted trigger without regarding whatever the target models are. To this end, a lightweight and black-box defense approach SifterNet is proposed through leveraging the memorization-association functionality of Hopfield network, by which the triggers of input samples can be effectively purified in a proper manner. The main novelty of our proposed approach lies in the introduction of ideology of Ising model. Extensive experiments also validate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of proper trigger purification and high accuracy achievement, and compared to the state-of-the-art baselines under several commonly-used datasets, our SiferNet has a significant superior performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.</p></details> |  |

Although some attacks have highlighted vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations, such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process. Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block, BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

In response, several concept erasure (defense) methods have been developed to prevent the generation of unwanted content through post-hoc finetuning. On the other hand, concept restoration (attack) methods seek to recover supposedly erased concepts via adversarially crafted prompts. However, all existing restoration methods only succeed in the highly restrictive scenario of finding adversarial prompts tailed to some fixed seed. To address this, we introduce RECORD, a novel coordinate-descent-based restoration algorithm that finds adversarial prompts to recover erased concepts independently of the seed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate RECORD consistently outperforms the current restoration methods by up to 17.8 times in this setting. Our findings further reveal the susceptibility of unlearned models to restoration attacks, providing crucial insights into the behavior of unlearned models under the influence of adversarial prompts.</p></details> |  |

By significantly reducing the time, expertise, and resources, AI-assisted cyberattacks orchestrated by LLM-based agents have led to a phenomenon termed Cyber Threat Inflation, characterized by a significant reduction in attack costs and a tremendous increase in attack scale. To provide actionable defensive insights, in this survey, we focus on the potential cyber threats posed by LLM-based agents across diverse network systems. Firstly, we present the capabilities of LLM-based cyberattack agents, which include executing autonomous attack strategies, comprising scouting, memory, reasoning, and action, and facilitating collaborative operations with other agents or human operators. Building on these capabilities, we examine common cyberattacks initiated by LLM-based agents and compare their effectiveness across different types of networks, including static, mobile, and infrastructure-free paradigms. Moreover, we analyze threat bottlenecks of LLM-based agents across different network infrastructures and review their defense methods. Due to operational imbalances, existing defense methods are inadequate against autonomous cyberattacks. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential defensive strategies for legacy network systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models That Walk the Talk: A Framework for Formal Fairness Certificates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12767v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success, large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions, posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment and content moderation.</p></details> |  |

We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space$\unicode{x2013}$the stylistic feature space$\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization, and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions become distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a metric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated distributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples become available. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to avoid reliance on machine-text detection.</p></details> |  |

In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, and resistance to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks. The persistent tension between the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[SifterNet: A Generalized and Model-Agnostic Trigger Purification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14531v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at resisting backdoor attacks in convolution neural networks and vision Transformer-based large model, this paper proposes a generalized and model-agnostic trigger-purification approach resorting to the classic Ising model. To date, existing trigger detection/removal studies usually require to know the detailed knowledge of target model in advance, access to a large number of clean samples or even model-retraining authorization, which brings the huge inconvenience for practical applications, especially inaccessible to target model. An ideal countermeasure ought to eliminate the implanted trigger without regarding whatever the target models are. To this end, a lightweight and black-box defense approach SifterNet is proposed through leveraging the memorization-association functionality of Hopfield network, by which the triggers of input samples can be effectively purified in a proper manner. The main novelty of our proposed approach lies in the introduction of ideology of Ising model. Extensive experiments also validate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of proper trigger purification and high accuracy achievement, and compared to the state-of-the-art baselines under several commonly-used datasets, our SiferNet has a significant superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafetyNet: Detecting Harmful Outputs in LLMs by Modeling and Monitoring Deceptive Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14300v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-risk industries like nuclear and aviation use real-time monitoring to detect dangerous system conditions. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and 2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using our unsupervised ensemble approach.</p></details> |  |
