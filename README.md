| **[Great, Now Write an Article About That: The Crescendo Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01833v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as jailbreaks, seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a simple multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b and LlaMA-3 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we present Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack and demonstrate its efficacy against state-of-the-art models through our evaluations. Crescendomation surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on the AdvBench subset dataset, achieving 29-61% higher performance on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro. Finally, we also demonstrate Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Surface-Level Patterns: An Essence-Driven Defense Framework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19041v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful requests, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying "attack essence" remains the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Investigating Generalization of One-shot LLM Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18862v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing steering vectors through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these vectors generalize. We consider several steering optimization techniques, including multiple novel ones, and find that the resulting vectors effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot steering vectors that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized steering vectors can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, to quantitatively assess steering effectiveness in instruction-tuned models, we develop a novel evaluation framework using sequence probabilities from the corresponding base model. With this framework, we analyze how steering vectors modulate an instruction-tuned LLM's ability to recover from outputting false information, and find that this ability derives from the base model. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing steering vectors on a single example can mediate misaligned behavior in LLMs, and provide a path toward better understanding the relationship between LLM behavior and activation space structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Efficient Safety Retrofitting Against Jailbreaking for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13603v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient alignment technique that steers LLMs towards preferable outputs by training on preference data, bypassing the need for explicit reward models. Its simplicity enables easy adaptation to various domains and safety requirements. This paper examines DPO's effectiveness in model safety against jailbreaking attacks while minimizing data requirements and training costs. We introduce Egida, a dataset expanded from multiple sources, which includes 27 different safety topics and 18 different attack styles, complemented with synthetic and human labels. This data is used to boost the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B/72B-Instruct) across topics and attack styles. In addition to safety evaluations, we assess their post-alignment performance degradation in general purpose tasks, and their tendency to over refusal. Following the proposed methodology, trained models reduce their Attack Success Rate by 10%-30%, using small training efforts (2,000 samples) with low computational cost (3\$ for 8B models, 20\$ for 72B models). Safety aligned models generalize to unseen topics and attack styles, with the most successful attack style reaching a success rate around 5%. Size and family are found to strongly influence model malleability towards safety, pointing at the importance of pre-training choices. To validate our findings, a large independent assessment of human preference agreement with Llama-Guard-3-8B is conducted by the authors and the associated dataset Egida-HSafe is released. Overall, this study illustrates how affordable and accessible it is to enhance LLM safety using DPO while outlining its current limitations. All datasets and models are released to enable reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Evaluations and Comparisons for LLM Unlearning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09179v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imperative to eliminate undesirable data memorization underscores the significance of machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs). Recent research has introduced a series of promising unlearning methods, notably boosting the practical significance of the field. Nevertheless, adopting a proper evaluation framework to reflect the true unlearning efficacy is also essential yet has not received adequate attention. This paper seeks to refine the evaluation of LLM unlearning by addressing two key challenges -- a) the robustness of evaluation metrics and b) the trade-offs between competing goals. The first challenge stems from findings that current metrics are susceptible to various red teaming scenarios. It indicates that they may not reflect the true extent of knowledge retained by LLMs but rather tend to mirror superficial model behaviors, thus prone to attacks. We address this issue by devising and assessing a series of candidate metrics, selecting the most robust ones under various types of attacks. The second challenge arises from the conflicting goals of eliminating unwanted knowledge while retaining those of others. This trade-off between unlearning and retention often fails to conform the Pareto frontier, rendering it subtle to compare the efficacy between methods that excel only in either unlearning or retention. We handle this issue by proposing a calibration method that can restore the original performance on non-targeted data after unlearning, thereby allowing us to focus exclusively on assessing the strength of unlearning. Our evaluation framework notably enhances the effectiveness when assessing and comparing various LLM unlearning methods, further allowing us to benchmark existing works, identify their proper hyper-parameters, and explore new tricks to enhance their practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and implementation of a distributed security threat detection system integrating federated learning and multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17763v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional security protection methods struggle to address sophisticated attack vectors in large-scale distributed systems, particularly when balancing detection accuracy with data privacy concerns. This paper presents a novel distributed security threat detection system that integrates federated learning with multimodal large language models (LLMs). Our system leverages federated learning to ensure data privacy while employing multimodal LLMs to process heterogeneous data sources including network traffic, system logs, images, and sensor data. Experimental evaluation on a 10TB distributed dataset demonstrates that our approach achieves 96.4% detection accuracy, outperforming traditional baseline models by 4.1 percentage points. The system reduces both false positive and false negative rates by 1.8 and 2.4 percentage points respectively. Performance analysis shows that our system maintains efficient processing capabilities in distributed environments, requiring 180 seconds for model training and 3.8 seconds for threat detection across the distributed network. These results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and computational efficiency while preserving data privacy, suggesting strong potential for real-world deployment in large-scale security systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAPILLON: Efficient and Stealthy Fuzz Testing-Powered Jailbreaks for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866v4)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[RapidPen: Fully Automated IP-to-Shell Penetration Testing with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16730v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted exploits in a fully automated manner. In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a 60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities, while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges. Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards LLM Unlearning Resilient to Relearning Attacks: A Sharpness-Aware Minimization Perspective and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05374v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

| **[On Calibration of LLM-based Guard Models for Reliable Content Moderation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10414v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for generating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

To alleviate the threat, existing defense strategies primarily focus on fine-tuning the entire suspicious model, yet offer only marginal resistance to state-of-the-art attacks and often result in a decrease in clean accuracy, particularly in data-limited scenarios. Their failure may be attributed to the mismatch between insufficient fine-tuning data and massive parameters in VLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Class-wise Backdoor Prompt Tuning (CBPT) defense, an efficient and effective method that operates on the text prompts to indirectly purify the poisoned VLMs. Specifically, we first employ the advanced contrastive learning via our carefully crafted positive and negative samples, to effectively invert the backdoor triggers that are potentially adopted by the attacker. Once the dummy trigger is established, we utilize the efficient prompt tuning technique to optimize these class-wise text prompts for modifying the model's decision boundary to further reclassify the feature regions of backdoor triggers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBPT significantly mitigates backdoor threats while preserving model utility, e.g. an average Clean Accuracy (CA) of 58.86\% and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.39\% across seven mainstream backdoor attacks. These results underscore the superiority of our prompt purifying design to strengthen model robustness against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Sample-Level Evaluation and Generative Framework for Model Inversion Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19070v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Inversion (MI) attacks, which reconstruct the training dataset of neural networks, pose significant privacy concerns in machine learning. Recent MI attacks have managed to reconstruct realistic label-level private data, such as the general appearance of a target person from all training images labeled on him. Beyond label-level privacy, in this paper we show sample-level privacy, the private information of a single target sample, is also important but under-explored in the MI literature due to the limitations of existing evaluation metrics. To address this gap, this study introduces a novel metric tailored for training-sample analysis, namely, the Diversity and Distance Composite Score (DDCS), which evaluates the reconstruction fidelity of each training sample by encompassing various MI attack attributes. This, in turn, enhances the precision of sample-level privacy assessments. Leveraging DDCS as a new evaluative lens, we observe that many training samples remain resilient against even the most advanced MI attack. As such, we further propose a transfer learning framework that augments the generative capabilities of MI attackers through the integration of entropy loss and natural gradient descent. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework on improving state-of-the-art MI attacks over various metrics including DDCS, coverage and FID. Finally, we demonstrate that DDCS can also be useful for MI defense, by identifying samples susceptible to MI attacks in an unsupervised manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be appeared in 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |
| **[A Dual-Purpose Framework for Backdoor Defense and Backdoor Amplification in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19047v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative frameworks, excelling in producing high-quality multi-modal samples. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where backdoored models generate specific, undesirable outputs called backdoor target (e.g., harmful images) when a pre-defined trigger is embedded to their inputs. In this paper, we propose PureDiffusion, a dual-purpose framework that simultaneously serves two contrasting roles: backdoor defense and backdoor attack amplification. For defense, we introduce two novel loss functions to invert backdoor triggers embedded in diffusion models. The first leverages trigger-induced distribution shifts across multiple timesteps of the diffusion process, while the second exploits the denoising consistency effect when a backdoor is activated. Once an accurate trigger inversion is achieved, we develop a backdoor detection method that analyzes both the inverted trigger and the generated backdoor targets to identify backdoor attacks. In terms of attack amplification with the role of an attacker, we describe how our trigger inversion algorithm can be used to reinforce the original trigger embedded in the backdoored diffusion model. This significantly boosts attack performance while reducing the required backdoor training time. Experimental results demonstrate that PureDiffusion achieves near-perfect detection accuracy, outperforming existing defenses by a large margin, particularly against complex trigger patterns. Additionally, in an attack scenario, our attack amplification approach elevates the attack success rate (ASR) of existing backdoor attacks to nearly 100\% while reducing training time by up to 20x.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Label-Only Membership Inference Attack against Pre-trained Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18943v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Although prior research has extensively explored MIAs in Large Language Models (LLMs), they typically require accessing to complete output logits (\ie, \textit{logits-based attacks}), which are usually not available in practice. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of pre-trained LLMs to MIAs in the \textit{label-only setting}, where the adversary can only access generated tokens (text). We first reveal that existing label-only MIAs have minor effects in attacking pre-trained LLMs, although they are highly effective in inferring fine-tuning datasets used for personalized LLMs. We find that their failure stems from two main reasons, including better generalization and overly coarse perturbation. Specifically, due to the extensive pre-training corpora and exposing each sample only a few times, LLMs exhibit minimal robustness differences between members and non-members. This makes token-level perturbations too coarse to capture such differences. To alleviate these problems, we propose \textbf{PETAL}: a label-only membership inference attack based on \textbf{PE}r-\textbf{T}oken sem\textbf{A}ntic simi\textbf{L}arity. Specifically, PETAL leverages token-level semantic similarity to approximate output probabilities and subsequently calculate the perplexity. It finally exposes membership based on the common assumption that members are `better' memorized and have smaller perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments on the WikiMIA benchmark and the more challenging MIMIR benchmark. Empirically, our PETAL performs better than the extensions of existing label-only attacks against personalized LLMs and even on par with other advanced logit-based attacks across all metrics on five prevalent open-source LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[JailBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Security Assessment Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18935v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive safety evaluations. In particular, the enhanced Chinese language proficiency of LLMs, combined with the unique characteristics and complexity of Chinese expressions, has driven the emergence of Chinese-specific benchmarks for safety assessment. However, these benchmarks generally fall short in effectively exposing LLM safety vulnerabilities. To address the gap, we introduce JailBench, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark for evaluating deep-seated vulnerabilities in LLMs, featuring a refined hierarchical safety taxonomy tailored to the Chinese context. To improve generation efficiency, we employ a novel Automatic Jailbreak Prompt Engineer (AJPE) framework for JailBench construction, which incorporates jailbreak techniques to enhance assessing effectiveness and leverages LLMs to automatically scale up the dataset through context-learning. The proposed JailBench is extensively evaluated over 13 mainstream LLMs and achieves the highest attack success rate against ChatGPT compared to existing Chinese benchmarks, underscoring its efficacy in identifying latent vulnerabilities in LLMs, as well as illustrating the substantial room for improvement in the security and trustworthiness of LLMs within the Chinese context. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/STAIR-BUPT/JailBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stealthy Backdoor Attack in Self-Supervised Learning Vision Encoders for Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18290v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) vision encoders learn high-quality image representations and thus have become a vital part of developing vision modality of large vision language models (LVLMs). Due to the high cost of training such encoders, pre-trained encoders are widely shared and deployed into many LVLMs, which are security-critical or bear societal significance. Under this practical scenario, we reveal a new backdoor threat that significant visual hallucinations can be induced into these LVLMs by merely compromising vision encoders. Because of the sharing and reuse of these encoders, many downstream LVLMs may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders, leading to widespread backdoors. In this work, we propose BadVision, the first method to exploit this vulnerability in SSL vision encoders for LVLMs with novel trigger optimization and backdoor learning techniques. We evaluate BadVision on two types of SSL encoders and LVLMs across eight benchmarks. We show that BadVision effectively drives the LVLMs to attacker-chosen hallucination with over 99% attack success rate, causing a 77.6% relative visual understanding error while maintaining the stealthiness. SoTA backdoor detection methods cannot detect our attack effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, their increasing impact on public opinion and information dissemination has made them a critical focus for security research due to inherent vulnerabilities. Previous studies have predominantly addressed attacks targeting factual or single-query manipulations. In this paper, we address a more practical scenario: topic-oriented adversarial opinion manipulation attacks on RAG models, where LLMs are required to reason and synthesize multiple perspectives, rendering them particularly susceptible to systematic knowledge poisoning. Specifically, we propose Topic-FlipRAG, a two-stage manipulation attack pipeline that strategically crafts adversarial perturbations to influence opinions across related queries. This approach combines traditional adversarial ranking attack techniques and leverages the extensive internal relevant knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to execute semantic-level perturbations. Experiments show that the proposed attacks effectively shift the opinion of the model's outputs on specific topics, significantly impacting user information perception. Current mitigation methods cannot effectively defend against such attacks, highlighting the necessity for enhanced safeguards for RAG systems, and offering crucial insights for LLM security research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalDiff: Causality-Inspired Disentanglement via Diffusion Model for Adversarial Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23091v7)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite ongoing efforts to defend neural classifiers from adversarial attacks, they remain vulnerable, especially to unseen attacks. In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39% (+4.01%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25% (+3.13%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62% (+4.93%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).

| **[Examining the Threat Landscape: Foundation Models and Model Stealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18077v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) for computer vision learn rich and robust representations, enabling their adaptation to task/domain-specific deployments with little to no fine-tuning. However, we posit that the very same strength can make applications based on FMs vulnerable to model stealing attacks. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that models fine-tuned from FMs harbor heightened susceptibility to model stealing, compared to conventional vision architectures like ResNets. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the comprehensive encoding of visual patterns and features learned by FMs during pre-training, which are accessible to both the attacker and the victim. We report that an attacker is able to obtain 94.28% agreement (matched predictions with victim) for a Vision Transformer based victim model (ViT-L/16) trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, compared to only 73.20% agreement for a ResNet-18 victim, when using ViT-L/16 as the thief model. We arguably show, for the first time, that utilizing FMs for downstream tasks may not be the best choice for deployment in commercial APIs due to their susceptibility to model theft. We thereby alert model owners towards the associated security risks, and highlight the need for robust security measures to safeguard such models against theft.

| **[Model-Free Adversarial Purification via Coarse-To-Fine Tensor Network Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17972v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense strategies have been proposed, many are tailored to the specific attacks or tasks and often fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose Tensor Network Purification (TNP), a novel model-free adversarial purification method by a specially designed tensor network decomposition algorithm. TNP depends neither on the pre-trained generative model nor the specific dataset, resulting in strong robustness across diverse adversarial scenarios. To this end, the key challenge lies in relaxing Gaussian-noise assumptions of classical decompositions and accommodating the unknown distribution of adversarial perturbations. Unlike the low-rank representation of classical decompositions, TNP aims to reconstruct the unobserved clean examples from an adversarial example. Specifically, TNP leverages progressive downsampling and introduces a novel adversarial optimization objective to address the challenge of minimizing reconstruction error but without inadvertently restoring adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively across various norm threats, attack types, and tasks, providing a versatile and promising adversarial purification technique.</p></details> |  |
