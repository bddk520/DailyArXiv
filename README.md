| **[Efficient Safety Retrofitting Against Jailbreaking for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13603v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient alignment technique that steers LLMs towards preferable outputs by training on preference data, bypassing the need for explicit reward models. Its simplicity enables easy adaptation to various domains and safety requirements. This paper examines DPO's effectiveness in model safety against jailbreaking attacks while minimizing data requirements and training costs. We introduce Egida, a dataset expanded from multiple sources, which includes 27 different safety topics and 18 different attack styles, complemented with synthetic and human labels. This data is used to boost the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B/72B-Instruct) across topics and attack styles. In addition to safety evaluations, we assess their post-alignment performance degradation in general purpose tasks, and their tendency to over refusal. Following the proposed methodology, trained models reduce their Attack Success Rate by 10%-30%, using small training efforts (2,000 samples) with low computational cost (3\$ for 8B models, 20\$ for 72B models). Safety aligned models generalize to unseen topics and attack styles, with the most successful attack style reaching a success rate around 5%. Size and family are found to strongly influence model malleability towards safety, pointing at the importance of pre-training choices. To validate our findings, a large independent assessment of human preference agreement with Llama-Guard-3-8B is conducted by the authors and the associated dataset Egida-HSafe is released. Overall, this study illustrates how affordable and accessible it is to enhance LLM safety using DPO while outlining its current limitations. All datasets and models are released to enable reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Evaluations and Comparisons for LLM Unlearning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09179v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imperative to eliminate undesirable data memorization underscores the significance of machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs). Recent research has introduced a series of promising unlearning methods, notably boosting the practical significance of the field. Nevertheless, adopting a proper evaluation framework to reflect the true unlearning efficacy is also essential yet has not received adequate attention. This paper seeks to refine the evaluation of LLM unlearning by addressing two key challenges -- a) the robustness of evaluation metrics and b) the trade-offs between competing goals. The first challenge stems from findings that current metrics are susceptible to various red teaming scenarios. It indicates that they may not reflect the true extent of knowledge retained by LLMs but rather tend to mirror superficial model behaviors, thus prone to attacks. We address this issue by devising and assessing a series of candidate metrics, selecting the most robust ones under various types of attacks. The second challenge arises from the conflicting goals of eliminating unwanted knowledge while retaining those of others. This trade-off between unlearning and retention often fails to conform the Pareto frontier, rendering it subtle to compare the efficacy between methods that excel only in either unlearning or retention. We handle this issue by proposing a calibration method that can restore the original performance on non-targeted data after unlearning, thereby allowing us to focus exclusively on assessing the strength of unlearning. Our evaluation framework notably enhances the effectiveness when assessing and comparing various LLM unlearning methods, further allowing us to benchmark existing works, identify their proper hyper-parameters, and explore new tricks to enhance their practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and implementation of a distributed security threat detection system integrating federated learning and multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17763v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional security protection methods struggle to address sophisticated attack vectors in large-scale distributed systems, particularly when balancing detection accuracy with data privacy concerns. This paper presents a novel distributed security threat detection system that integrates federated learning with multimodal large language models (LLMs). Our system leverages federated learning to ensure data privacy while employing multimodal LLMs to process heterogeneous data sources including network traffic, system logs, images, and sensor data. Experimental evaluation on a 10TB distributed dataset demonstrates that our approach achieves 96.4% detection accuracy, outperforming traditional baseline models by 4.1 percentage points. The system reduces both false positive and false negative rates by 1.8 and 2.4 percentage points respectively. Performance analysis shows that our system maintains efficient processing capabilities in distributed environments, requiring 180 seconds for model training and 3.8 seconds for threat detection across the distributed network. These results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and computational efficiency while preserving data privacy, suggesting strong potential for real-world deployment in large-scale security systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAPILLON: Efficient and Stealthy Fuzz Testing-Powered Jailbreaks for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866v4)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[RapidPen: Fully Automated IP-to-Shell Penetration Testing with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16730v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted exploits in a fully automated manner. In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a 60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities, while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges. Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards LLM Unlearning Resilient to Relearning Attacks: A Sharpness-Aware Minimization Perspective and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05374v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

| **[On Calibration of LLM-based Guard Models for Reliable Content Moderation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10414v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for generating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A generative approach to LLM harmfulness detection with special red flag tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16366v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Humanizing the Machine: Proxy Attacks to Mislead LLM Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19230v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Merger-as-a-Stealer: Stealing Targeted PII from Aligned LLMs with Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16094v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by integrating multiple domain-specific models into a cross-domain merged model. Despite its utility and plug-and-play nature, unmonitored mergers can introduce significant security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks and model merging abuse. In this paper, we identify a novel and more realistic attack surface where a malicious merger can extract targeted personally identifiable information (PII) from an aligned model with model merging. Specifically, we propose \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer}, a two-stage framework to achieve this attack: First, the attacker fine-tunes a malicious model to force it to respond to any PII-related queries. The attacker then uploads this malicious model to the model merging conductor and obtains the merged model. Second, the attacker inputs direct PII-related queries to the merged model to extract targeted PII. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer} successfully executes attacks against various LLMs and model merging methods across diverse settings, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Given that this attack enables character-level extraction for targeted PII without requiring any additional knowledge from the attacker, we stress the necessity for improved model alignment and more robust defense mechanisms to mitigate such threats.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Due to the high cost of training such encoders, pre-trained encoders are widely shared and deployed into many LVLMs, which are security-critical or bear societal significance. Under this practical scenario, we reveal a new backdoor threat that significant visual hallucinations can be induced into these LVLMs by merely compromising vision encoders. Because of the sharing and reuse of these encoders, many downstream LVLMs may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders, leading to widespread backdoors. In this work, we propose BadVision, the first method to exploit this vulnerability in SSL vision encoders for LVLMs with novel trigger optimization and backdoor learning techniques. We evaluate BadVision on two types of SSL encoders and LVLMs across eight benchmarks. We show that BadVision effectively drives the LVLMs to attacker-chosen hallucination with over 99% attack success rate, causing a 77.6% relative visual understanding error while maintaining the stealthiness. SoTA backdoor detection methods cannot detect our attack effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, their increasing impact on public opinion and information dissemination has made them a critical focus for security research due to inherent vulnerabilities. Previous studies have predominantly addressed attacks targeting factual or single-query manipulations. In this paper, we address a more practical scenario: topic-oriented adversarial opinion manipulation attacks on RAG models, where LLMs are required to reason and synthesize multiple perspectives, rendering them particularly susceptible to systematic knowledge poisoning. Specifically, we propose Topic-FlipRAG, a two-stage manipulation attack pipeline that strategically crafts adversarial perturbations to influence opinions across related queries. This approach combines traditional adversarial ranking attack techniques and leverages the extensive internal relevant knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to execute semantic-level perturbations. Experiments show that the proposed attacks effectively shift the opinion of the model's outputs on specific topics, significantly impacting user information perception. Current mitigation methods cannot effectively defend against such attacks, highlighting the necessity for enhanced safeguards for RAG systems, and offering crucial insights for LLM security research.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39% (+4.01%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25% (+3.13%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62% (+4.93%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).

However, we posit that the very same strength can make applications based on FMs vulnerable to model stealing attacks. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that models fine-tuned from FMs harbor heightened susceptibility to model stealing, compared to conventional vision architectures like ResNets. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the comprehensive encoding of visual patterns and features learned by FMs during pre-training, which are accessible to both the attacker and the victim. We report that an attacker is able to obtain 94.28% agreement (matched predictions with victim) for a Vision Transformer based victim model (ViT-L/16) trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, compared to only 73.20% agreement for a ResNet-18 victim, when using ViT-L/16 as the thief model. We arguably show, for the first time, that utilizing FMs for downstream tasks may not be the best choice for deployment in commercial APIs due to their susceptibility to model theft. We thereby alert model owners towards the associated security risks, and highlight the need for robust security measures to safeguard such models against theft.

| **[Model-Free Adversarial Purification via Coarse-To-Fine Tensor Network Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17972v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense strategies have been proposed, many are tailored to the specific attacks or tasks and often fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose Tensor Network Purification (TNP), a novel model-free adversarial purification method by a specially designed tensor network decomposition algorithm. TNP depends neither on the pre-trained generative model nor the specific dataset, resulting in strong robustness across diverse adversarial scenarios. To this end, the key challenge lies in relaxing Gaussian-noise assumptions of classical decompositions and accommodating the unknown distribution of adversarial perturbations. Unlike the low-rank representation of classical decompositions, TNP aims to reconstruct the unobserved clean examples from an adversarial example. Specifically, TNP leverages progressive downsampling and introduces a novel adversarial optimization objective to address the challenge of minimizing reconstruction error but without inadvertently restoring adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively across various norm threats, attack types, and tasks, providing a versatile and promising adversarial purification technique.</p></details> |  |

However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source R1 models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on R1 is needed. (2) The distilled reasoning model shows poorer safety performance compared to its safety-aligned base models. (3) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions. (4) The thinking process in R1 models pose greater safety concerns than their final answers. Our study provides insights into the security implications of reasoning models and highlights the need for further advancements in R1 models' safety to close the gap.</p></details> |  |

The latest deep learning-based solutions offer higher efficiency, lower distortion, and better hardware support compared to traditional ones like MPEG and JPEG. However, privacy threats arise, especially reconstruction attacks targeting to recover the original input point cloud from the intermediate results. In this paper, we design VVRec, to the best of our knowledge, which is the first targeting DL-based Volumetric Video Reconstruction attack scheme. VVRec demonstrates the ability to reconstruct high-quality point clouds from intercepted transmission intermediate results using four well-trained neural network modules we design. Leveraging the latest latent diffusion models with Gamma distribution and a refinement algorithm, VVRec excels in reconstruction quality, color recovery, and surpasses existing defenses. We evaluate VVRec using three volumetric video datasets. The results demonstrate that VVRec achieves 64.70dB reconstruction accuracy, with an impressive 46.39% reduction of distortion over baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although efforts have been made to protect PII in LLMs, existing methods struggle to balance privacy protection with maintaining model utility. In this paper, inspired by studies of amnesia in cognitive science, we propose a novel approach, Proactive Privacy Amnesia (PPA), to safeguard PII in LLMs while preserving their utility. This mechanism works by actively identifying and forgetting key memories most closely associated with PII in sequences, followed by a memory implanting using suitable substitute memories to maintain the LLM's functionality. We conduct evaluations across multiple models to protect common PII, such as phone numbers and physical addresses, against prevalent PII-targeted attacks, demonstrating the superiority of our method compared with other existing defensive techniques. The results show that our PPA method completely eliminates the risk of phone number exposure by 100% and significantly reduces the risk of physical address exposure by 9.8% - 87.6%, all while maintaining comparable model utility performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Poster.

| **[The Geometry of Refusal in Large Language Models: Concept Cones and Representational Independence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17420v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) can be circumvented through adversarially crafted inputs, yet the mechanisms by which these attacks bypass safety barriers remain poorly understood. Prior work suggests that a single refusal direction in the model's activation space determines whether an LLM refuses a request. In this study, we propose a novel gradient-based approach to representation engineering and use it to identify refusal directions. Contrary to prior work, we uncover multiple independent directions and even multi-dimensional concept cones that mediate refusal. Moreover, we show that orthogonality alone does not imply independence under intervention, motivating the notion of representational independence that accounts for both linear and non-linear effects. Using this framework, we identify mechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms in LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally independent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive refusal behavior. Our gradient-based approach uncovers these mechanisms and can further serve as a foundation for future work on understanding LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) show promise in providing such natural language interpretations of data, yet simple feature extraction methods such as prompting often fail to produce accurate and versatile descriptions for diverse datasets and lack control over granularity and scale. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic method for dataset featurization that provides precise control over the number of features extracted while maintaining compact and descriptive representations comparable to human expert labeling. Our method optimizes the selection of informative binary features by evaluating the ability of an LLM to reconstruct the original data using those features. We demonstrate its effectiveness in dataset modeling tasks and through two case studies: (1) Constructing a feature representation of jailbreak tactics that compactly captures both the effectiveness and diversity of a larger set of human-crafted attacks; and (2) automating the discovery of features that align with human preferences, achieving accuracy and robustness comparable to expert-crafted features. Moreover, we show that the pipeline scales effectively, improving as additional features are sampled, making it suitable for large and diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
