| **[CyberExplorer: Benchmarking LLM Offensive Security Capabilities in a Real-World Attacking Simulation Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08023v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world offensive security operations are inherently open-ended: attackers explore unknown attack surfaces, revise hypotheses under uncertainty, and operate without guaranteed success. Existing LLM-based offensive agent evaluations rely on closed-world settings with predefined goals and binary success criteria. To address this gap, we introduce CyberExplorer, an evaluation suite with two core components: (1) an open-environment benchmark built on a virtual machine hosting 40 vulnerable web services derived from real-world CTF challenges, where agents autonomously perform reconnaissance, target selection, and exploitation without prior knowledge of vulnerability locations; and (2) a reactive multi-agent framework supporting dynamic exploration without predefined plans. CyberExplorer enables fine-grained evaluation beyond flag recovery, capturing interaction dynamics, coordination behavior, failure modes, and vulnerability discovery signals-bridging the gap between benchmarks and realistic multi-target attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop Testing Attacks, Start Diagnosing Defenses: The Four-Checkpoint Framework Reveals Where LLM Safety Breaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09629v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, yet these defenses remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts. While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \textit{where} defenses fail or \textit{why}. To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers. Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation. Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\%, a 2.3$\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\%) and Gemini (59.5\%). These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques. The Four-Checkpoint Framework provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing safety vulnerabilities in deployed systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, pre-print |
| **[The Devil behind the mask: An emergent safety vulnerability of Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11097v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling. However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

| **[Targeting Alignment: Extracting Safety Classifiers of Aligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16534v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new technique for jailbreak attacks. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the LLM responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance, and seek to extract an approximation of this classifier: a surrogate classifier. To this end, we build candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM. We first evaluate the degree to which candidate classifiers approximate the LLM's safety classifier in benign and adversarial settings. Then, we attack the candidates and measure how well the resulting adversarial inputs transfer to the LLM. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find that attacks mounted on the surrogate classifiers can be transferred to the LLM with high success. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70% with half the memory footprint and runtime -- a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is an effective and efficient means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/jcnf0/targeting-alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 4th IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML'26)</p></details> |
| **[SearchAttack: Red-Teaming LLMs against Knowledge-to-Action Threats under Online Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04093v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, people have suffered from LLM hallucination and have become increasingly aware of the reliability gap of LLMs in open and knowledge-intensive tasks. As a result, they have increasingly turned to search-augmented LLMs to mitigate this issue. However, LLM-driven search also becomes an attractive target for misuse. Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful instructions or takeaways for users, it becomes difficult to withdraw or undo such exposure. To investigate LLMs' unsafe search behavior issues, we first propose \textbf{\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming, which (1) rephrases harmful semantics via dense and benign knowledge to evade direct in-context decoding, thus eliciting unsafe information retrieval, (2) stress-tests LLMs' reward-chasing bias by steering them to synthesize unsafe retrieved content. We also curate an emergent, domain-specific illicit activity benchmark for search-based threat assessment, and introduce a fact-checking framework to ground and quantify harm in both offline and online attack settings. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment. Empirically, SearchAttack demonstrates strong effectiveness in attacking these systems. We also find that LLMs without web search can still be steered into harmful content output due to their information-seeking stereotypical behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Misus...</summary><p>Misusing LLM-driven search for harmful information-seeking poses serious risks.

| **[Sparse Models, Sparse Safety: Unsafe Routes in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08621v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By introducing routers to selectively activate experts in Transformer layers, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture significantly reduces computational costs in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining competitive performance, especially for models with massive parameters. However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs + Security = Trouble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08422v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that when it comes to producing secure code with AI, the prevailing "fighting fire with fire" approach -- using probabilistic AI-based checkers or attackers to secure probabilistically generated code -- fails to address the long tail of security bugs. As a result, systems may remain exposed to zero-day vulnerabilities that can be discovered by better-resourced or more persistent adversaries. While neurosymbolic approaches that combine LLMs with formal methods are attractive in principle, we argue that they are difficult to reconcile with the "vibe coding" workflow common in LLM-assisted development: unless the end-to-end verification pipeline is fully automated, developers are repeatedly asked to validate specifications, resolve ambiguities, and adjudicate failures, making the human-in-the-loop a likely point of weakness, compromising secure-by-construction guarantees. In this paper we argue that stronger security guarantees can be obtained by enforcing security constraints during code generation (e.g., via constrained decoding), rather than relying solely on post-hoc detection and repair. This direction is particularly promising for diffusion-style code models, whose approach provides a natural elegant opportunity for modular, hierarchical security enforcement, allowing us to combine lower-latency generation techniques with generating secure-by-construction code.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Trust-Authorization Mismatch in LLM Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06914v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous agents capable of executing complex workflows via standardized protocols (e.g., MCP). However, this paradigm shifts control from deterministic code to probabilistic inference, creating a fundamental Trust-Authorization Mismatch: static permissions are structurally decoupled from the agent's fluctuating runtime trustworthiness. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we survey more than 200 representative papers to categorize the emerging landscape of agent security. We propose the Belief-Intention-Permission (B-I-P) framework as a unifying formal lens. By decomposing agent execution into three distinct stages-Belief Formation, Intent Generation, and Permission Grant-we demonstrate that diverse threats, from prompt injection to tool poisoning, share a common root cause: the desynchronization between dynamic trust states and static authorization boundaries. Using the B-I-P lens, we systematically map existing attacks and defenses and identify critical gaps where current mechanisms fail to bridge this mismatch. Finally, we outline a research agenda for shifting from static Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to dynamic, risk-adaptive authorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Adaptable Detection of Malicious LLM Prompts via Bootstrap Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08062v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, these systems remain susceptible to malicious prompts that induce unsafe or policy-violating behavior through harmful requests, jailbreak techniques, and prompt injection attacks. Existing defenses face fundamental limitations: black-box moderation APIs offer limited transparency and adapt poorly to evolving threats, while white-box approaches using large LLM judges impose prohibitive computational costs and require expensive retraining for new attacks. Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features. Our results show ensembles of small finetuned classifiers can match or exceed billion-parameter guardrails while offering the adaptability and efficiency required for production systems.</p></details> |  |

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning. Finally, we discuss detection challenges and outline directions for stress-testing and evaluation, with the goal of anticipating and controlling future developments.

| **[Towards Poisoning Robustness Certification for Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09757v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reliability of natural language generation is critical for deploying foundation models in security-sensitive domains. While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Model Extraction via Factual and Counterfactual Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09748v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In model extraction attacks, the goal is to reveal the parameters of a black-box machine learning model by querying the model for a selected set of data points. Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed. In contrast, when using polyhedral distances for instance, the number of required queries grows linearly with the dimension of the data space. For robust counterfactuals, the latter number of queries doubles. Consequently, the applied distance function and robustness of counterfactuals have a significant impact on the model's security.</p></details> |  |

However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.</p></details> | preprint |

We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs.</p></details> |  |

Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review; 21 pages</p></details> |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a revised version of a manuscript currently under revision at the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as the root cause of the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a new architectural element, ASIDE, that allows language models to clearly separate instructions and data at the level of token embeddings. ASIDE applies an orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating clearly distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. As we demonstrate experimentally across a range of models, instruction-tuning LLMs with ASIDE (1) achieves substantially higher instruction-data separation without performance loss and (2) makes the models more robust to prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we provide insights into the mechanism underlying our method through an analysis of the model representations.

MoE LLMs improve scaling efficiency by activating only a small subset of parameters per token, but their routing structure introduces new safety attack surfaces. We find that safety-critical behaviors in MoE LLMs (e.g., refusal) are concentrated in a small set of experts rather than being uniformly distributed. Building on this, we propose Large Language Lobotomy (L$^3$), a training-free, architecture-agnostic attack that compromises safety alignment by exploiting expert routing dynamics. L$^3$ learns routing patterns that correlate with refusal, attributes safety behavior to specific experts, and adaptively silences the most safety-relevant experts until harmful outputs are produced. We evaluate L$^3$ on eight state-of-the-art open-source MoE LLMs and show that our adaptive expert silencing increases average attack success from 7.3% to 70.4%, reaching up to 86.3%, outperforming prior training-free MoE jailbreak methods. Moreover, bypassing guardrails typically requires silencing fewer than 20% of layer-wise experts while largely preserving general language utility. These results reveal a fundamental tension between efficiency-driven MoE design and robust safety alignment and motivate distributing safety mechanisms more robustly in future MoE LLMs with architecture- and routing-aware methods.</p></details> |  |

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE.</p></details> |  |

While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
