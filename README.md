| **[LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15606v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.</p></details> |  |

Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., "DevOps Engineer") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLMs Copy to Think: Uncovering Copy-Guided Attacks in Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16773v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to automated code analysis, enabling tasks such as vulnerability detection and code comprehension. However, their integration introduces novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we identify and investigate a new class of prompt-based attacks, termed Copy-Guided Attacks (CGA), which exploit the inherent copying tendencies of reasoning-capable LLMs. By injecting carefully crafted triggers into external code snippets, adversaries can induce the model to replicate malicious content during inference. This behavior enables two classes of vulnerabilities: inference length manipulation, where the model generates abnormally short or excessively long reasoning traces; and inference result manipulation, where the model produces misleading or incorrect conclusions. We formalize CGA as an optimization problem and propose a gradient-based approach to synthesize effective triggers. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs shows that CGA reliably induces infinite loops, premature termination, false refusals, and semantic distortions in code analysis tasks. While highly effective in targeted settings, we observe challenges in generalizing CGA across diverse prompts due to computational constraints, posing an open question for future research. Our findings expose a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in LLM-powered development pipelines and call for urgent advances in prompt-level defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth Gives a False Sense of Privacy: LLM Internal States Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16372v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines, yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025.

| **[ShadowCode: Towards (Automatic) External Prompt Injection Attack against Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v6)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have led to the widespread adoption of code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) for programming tasks. Despite their success in deployment, their security research is left far behind. This paper introduces a new attack paradigm: (automatic) external prompt injection against Code LLMs, where attackers generate concise, non-functional induced perturbations and inject them within a victim's code context. These induced perturbations can be disseminated through commonly used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base), manipulating Code LLMs to achieve malicious objectives during the code completion process. Compared to existing attacks, this method is more realistic and threatening: it does not necessitate control over the model's training process, unlike backdoor attacks, and can achieve specific malicious objectives that are challenging for adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we propose ShadowCode, a simple yet effective method that automatically generates induced perturbations based on code simulation to achieve effective and stealthy external prompt injection. ShadowCode designs its perturbation optimization objectives by simulating realistic code contexts and employs a greedy optimization approach with two enhancement modules: forward reasoning enhancement and keyword-based perturbation design. We evaluate our method across 13 distinct malicious objectives, generating 31 threat cases spanning three popular programming languages. Our results demonstrate that ShadowCode successfully attacks three representative open-source Code LLMs (achieving up to a 97.9% attack success rate) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with over 90% attack success rate) across all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional induced perturbation. The code is available at https://github.com/LianPing-cyber/ShadowCodeEPI.</p></details> |  |
| **[OMNISEC: LLM-Driven Provenance-based Intrusion Detection via Retrieval-Augmented Behavior Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03108v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have been widely used for endpoint threat analysis. These studies can be broadly categorized into rule-based detection systems and learning-based detection systems. Among these, due to the evolution of attack techniques, rules cannot dynamically model all the characteristics of attackers. As a result, such systems often face false negatives. Learning-based detection systems are further divided into supervised learning and anomaly detection. The scarcity of attack samples hinders the usability and effectiveness of supervised learning-based detection systems in practical applications. Anomaly-based detection systems face a massive false positive problem because they cannot distinguish between changes in normal behavior and real attack behavior. The alert results of detection systems are closely related to the manual labor costs of subsequent security analysts. To reduce manual analysis time, we propose OMNISEC, which applies large language models (LLMs) to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems via retrieval-augmented behavior prompting. OMNISEC can identify abnormal nodes and corresponding abnormal events by constructing suspicious nodes and rare paths. By combining two external knowledge bases, OMNISEC uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable the LLM to determine whether abnormal behavior is a real attack. Finally, OMNISEC can reconstruct the attack graph and restore the complete attack behavior chain of the attacker's intrusion. Experimental results show that OMNISEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning (ML)-based classifiers have shown promise in detecting malicious call transcripts, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations that preserve semantic content. In this study, we explore a novel attack vector where large language models (LLMs) are leveraged to generate adversarial vishing transcripts that evade detection while maintaining deceptive intent. We construct a systematic attack pipeline that employs prompt engineering and semantic obfuscation to transform real-world vishing scripts using four commercial LLMs. The generated transcripts are evaluated against multiple ML classifiers trained on a real-world Korean vishing dataset (KorCCViD) with statistical testing. Our experiments reveal that LLM-generated transcripts are both practically and statistically effective against ML-based classifiers. In particular, transcripts crafted by GPT-4o significantly reduce classifier accuracy (by up to 30.96%) while maintaining high semantic similarity, as measured by BERTScore. Moreover, these attacks are both time-efficient and cost-effective, with average generation times under 9 seconds and negligible financial cost per query. The results underscore the pressing need for more resilient vishing detection frameworks and highlight the imperative for LLM providers to enforce stronger safeguards against prompt misuse in adversarial social engineering contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EAI ICDF2C 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Stage Prompt Inference Attacks on Enterprise LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15613v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place. We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both attacks and defenses.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Based on our experiments, we found that the effectiveness of jailbreak strategies is influenced by the comprehension ability of the attacked LLM. Building on this insight, we propose a capability-aware Multi-Encryption Framework (MEF) for evaluating vulnerabilities in black-box LLMs. Specifically, MEF first categorizes the comprehension ability level of the LLM, then applies different strategies accordingly: For models with limited comprehension ability, MEF adopts the Fu+En1 strategy, which integrates layered semantic mutations with an encryption technique, more effectively contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the input and inference stages. For models with strong comprehension ability, MEF uses a more complex Fu+En1+En2 strategy, in which additional dual-ended encryption techniques are applied to the LLM's responses, further contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the output stage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates of 98.9% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release) and 99.8% on GPT-4.1 (8 July 2025 release). Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities in current LLM alignment mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gungnir: Exploiting Stylistic Features in Images for Backdoor Attacks on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20650v4)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated significant advances in the field of image generation. However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily observed by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more susceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of backdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks by introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term Timesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images that are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both manual inspection and automated detection neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that Gungnir can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0 backdoor detection rate (BDR). Our codes are available at https://github.com/paoche11/Gungnir.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4MEA: Data-free Model Extraction Attacks on Sequential Recommenders via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16969v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of sequential recommender systems to Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). MEAs collect responses from recommender systems to replicate their functionality, enabling unauthorized deployments and posing critical privacy and security risks. Black-box attacks in prior MEAs are ineffective at exposing recommender system vulnerabilities due to random sampling in data selection, which leads to misaligned synthetic and real-world distributions. To overcome this limitation, we propose LLM4MEA, a novel model extraction method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as human-like rankers to generate data. It generates data through interactions between the LLM ranker and target recommender system. In each interaction, the LLM ranker analyzes historical interactions to understand user behavior, and selects items from recommendations with consistent preferences to extend the interaction history, which serves as training data for MEA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4MEA significantly outperforms existing approaches in data quality and attack performance, reducing the divergence between synthetic and real-world data by up to 64.98% and improving MEA performance by 44.82% on average. From a defensive perspective, we propose a simple yet effective defense strategy and identify key hyperparameters of recommender systems that can mitigate the risk of MEAs.</p></details> |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updated results and expanded discussion</p></details> |

The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANSdataset benchmark is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range of aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$) to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the training phase, but underperformed during testing. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, submitted to EWTEC</p></details> |
| **[Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations (AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD) approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems, this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks</p></details> | Accepted at FG 2025 |

Users can access different compressed model versions according to their resources and budget. However, while existing compression operations primarily focus on optimizing the trade-off between resource efficiency and model performance, the privacy risks introduced by compression remain overlooked and insufficiently understood. In this work, through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA), we propose CompLeak, the first privacy risk evaluation framework examining three widely used compression configurations that are pruning, quantization, and weight clustering supported by the commercial model compression framework of Google's TensorFlow-Lite (TF-Lite) and Facebook's PyTorch Mobile. CompLeak has three variants, given available access to the number of compressed models and original model. CompLeakNR starts by adopting existing MIA methods to attack a single compressed model, and identifies that different compressed models influence members and non-members differently. When the original model and one compressed model are available, CompLeakSR leverages the compressed model as a reference to the original model and uncovers more privacy by combining meta information (e.g., confidence vector) from both models. When multiple compressed models are available with/without accessing the original model, CompLeakMR innovatively exploits privacy leakage info from multiple compressed versions to substantially signify the overall privacy leakage. We conduct extensive experiments on seven diverse model architectures (from ResNet to foundation models of BERT and GPT-2), and six image and textual benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples.

| **[Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data, and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance. To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods -- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 Accepted |
