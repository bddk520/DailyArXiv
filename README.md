| **[Multi-Stage Prompt Inference Attacks on Enterprise LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15613v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place. We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both attacks and defenses.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[From LLMs to MLLMs to Agents: A Survey of Emerging Paradigms in Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses within LLM Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15170v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Coordination of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14928v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents is a promising approach to overcome inherent limitations of single-agent systems, such as hallucinations and single points of failure. As LLM agents are increasingly deployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of tolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential. Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven coordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are inherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive leaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus, forcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high latency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader can be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are available, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives a quorum of votes. To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized consensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate answers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these answers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture enables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and consistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates Byzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.</p></details> |  |

We show that adversaries can embed universal adversarial triggers in webpage HTML to hijack agent behavior that utilizes the accessibility tree to parse HTML, causing unintended or malicious actions. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm and a Browser Gym agent powered by Llama-3.1, our system demonstrates high success rates across real websites in both targeted and general attacks, including login credential exfiltration and forced ad clicks. Our empirical results highlight critical security risks and the need for stronger defenses as LLM-driven autonomous web agents become more widely adopted. The system software (https://github.com/sej2020/manipulating-web-agents) is released under the MIT License, with an accompanying publicly available demo website (http://lethaiq.github.io/attack-web-llm-agent).</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 System Demonstrations Submission</p></details> |
| **[Configurable multi-agent framework for scalable and realistic testing of llm-based agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14705v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing obsolete. We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like conversations that adapt after every turn. Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i) uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered 10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45 mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts. Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release the framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OMNISEC: LLM-Driven Provenance-based Intrusion Detection via Retrieval-Augmented Behavior Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03108v3)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have been widely used for endpoint threat analysis. These studies can be broadly categorized into rule-based detection systems and learning-based detection systems. Among these, due to the evolution of attack techniques, rules cannot dynamically model all the characteristics of attackers. As a result, such systems often face false negatives. Learning-based detection systems are further divided into supervised learning and anomaly detection. The scarcity of attack samples hinders the usability and effectiveness of supervised learning-based detection systems in practical applications. Anomaly-based detection systems face a massive false positive problem because they cannot distinguish between changes in normal behavior and real attack behavior. The alert results of detection systems are closely related to the manual labor costs of subsequent security analysts. To reduce manual analysis time, we propose OMNISEC, which applies large language models (LLMs) to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems via retrieval-augmented behavior prompting. OMNISEC can identify abnormal nodes and corresponding abnormal events by constructing suspicious nodes and rare paths. By combining two external knowledge bases, OMNISEC uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable the LLM to determine whether abnormal behavior is a real attack. Finally, OMNISEC can reconstruct the attack graph and restore the complete attack behavior chain of the attacker's intrusion. Experimental results show that OMNISEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blackbox Dataset Inference for LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03619v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the training of large language models (LLMs) can involve personally identifiable information and copyrighted material, incurring dataset misuse. To mitigate the problem of dataset misuse, this paper explores \textit{dataset inference}, which aims to detect if a suspect model $\mathcal{M}$ used a victim dataset $\mathcal{D}$ in training. Previous research tackles dataset inference by aggregating results of membership inference attacks (MIAs) -- methods to determine whether individual samples are a part of the training dataset. However, restricted by the low accuracy of MIAs, previous research mandates grey-box access to $\mathcal{M}$ to get intermediate outputs (probabilities, loss, perplexity, etc.) for obtaining satisfactory results. This leads to reduced practicality, as LLMs, especially those deployed for profits, have limited incentives to return the intermediate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new method of dataset inference with only black-box access to the target model (i.e., assuming only the text-based responses of the target model are available). Our method is enabled by two sets of locally built reference models, one set involving $\mathcal{D}$ in training and the other not. By measuring which set of reference model $\mathcal{M}$ is closer to, we determine if $\mathcal{M}$ used $\mathcal{D}$ for training. Evaluations of real-world LLMs in the wild show that our method offers high accuracy in all settings and presents robustness against bypassing attempts.</p></details> |  |

So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final Version and Paper Accepted at IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[How Not to Detect Prompt Injections with an LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05630v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paper Summary Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs through LLM Safety Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13474v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings. Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack (\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available at https://github.com/233liang/Paper-Summary-Attack</p></details> |  |

While the diffusion model (DM) has been broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of its backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive studies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose \textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large language model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability.

We propose CatAttack, an automated iterative attack pipeline for generating triggers on a weaker, less expensive proxy model (DeepSeek V3) and successfully transfer them to more advanced reasoning target models like DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-distilled-Qwen-32B, resulting in greater than 300% increase in the likelihood of the target model generating an incorrect answer. For example, appending, "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives," to any math problem leads to more than doubling the chances of a model getting the answer wrong. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in reasoning models, revealing that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to subtle adversarial inputs, raising security and reliability concerns.

| **[In-context Learning of Vision Language Models for Detection of Physical and Digital Attacks against Face Recognition Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15285v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges, including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving generalisation in attack detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-TIFS</p></details> |
| **[ROBAD: Robust Adversary-aware Local-Global Attended Bad Actor Detection Sequential Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15067v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting bad actors is critical to ensure the safety and integrity of internet platforms. Several deep learning-based models have been developed to identify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors, but also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection. However, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness requirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input sequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model understanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the model can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To achieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model, called ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection model), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to detect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder block to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to capture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the transformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post embeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence embedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to enrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked attackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for sequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information (i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors of bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can effectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 tables |

However, the increasing system scale and data dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens, particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14 figures |

Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking</p></details> |  |

To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model.

Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Worki...</summary><p>Working in progress. 22 pages (8+ for main); 25 figures; 1 table</p></details> |

| **[BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While the diffusion model (DM) has been broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of its backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive studies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose \textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large language model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.</p></details> |  |

We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
