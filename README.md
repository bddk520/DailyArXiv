| **[Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient. While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient) attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender) through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery, while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for building privacy-aware agents.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Jailbreaking Commercial Black-Box LLMs with Explicitly Harmful Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10390v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness. However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets, judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository: https://github.com/AlienZhang1996/DH-CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaCipher: A Time-Persistent and Universal Multi-Agent Framework for Cipher-Based Jailbreak Attacks for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22557v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face growing vulnerability to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. While developers invest heavily in alignment finetuning and safety guardrails, researchers continue publishing novel attacks, driving progress through adversarial iteration. This dynamic mirrors a strategic game of continual evolution. However, two major challenges hinder jailbreak development: the high cost of querying top-tier LLMs and the short lifespan of effective attacks due to frequent safety updates. These factors limit cost-efficiency and practical impact of research in jailbreak attacks. To address this, we propose MetaCipher, a low-cost, multi-agent jailbreak framework that generalizes across LLMs with varying safety measures. Using reinforcement learning, MetaCipher is modular and adaptive, supporting extensibility to future strategies. Within as few as 10 queries, MetaCipher achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent malicious prompt benchmarks, outperforming prior jailbreak methods. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation across diverse victim models and benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. Warning: This paper contains model outputs that may be offensive or harmful, shown solely to demonstrate jailbreak efficacy.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guardians and Offenders: A Survey on Harmful Content Generation and Safety Mitigation of LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05775v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques. We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuronTune: Fine-Grained Neuron Modulation for Balanced Safety-Utility Alignment in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09473v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries, degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds, supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM Serving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20002v4)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

| **[Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache in LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09442v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-shot Optimized Steering Vectors Mediate Safety-relevant Behaviors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18862v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on "emergent misalignment" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025. 30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Can AI Keep a Secret? Contextual Integrity Verification: A Provable Security Architecture for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09288v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) remain acutely vulnerable to prompt injection and related jailbreak attacks; heuristic guardrails (rules, filters, LLM judges) are routinely bypassed. We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 3 tables; code and certification harness: https://github.com/ayushgupta4897/Contextual-Integrity-Verification ; Elite-Attack dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/zyushg/elite-attack</p></details> |

| **[Leveraging large language models for SQL behavior-based database intrusion detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05690v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Transformer-based Model for Phishing Email Detection: A Large Language Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13871v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing email is a serious cyber threat that tries to deceive users by sending false emails with the intention of stealing confidential information or causing financial harm. Attackers, often posing as trustworthy entities, exploit technological advancements and sophistication to make detection and prevention of phishing more challenging. Despite extensive academic research, phishing detection remains an ongoing and formidable challenge in the cybersecurity landscape. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Masked Language Models (MLMs) possess immense potential to offer innovative solutions to address long-standing challenges. In this research paper, we present an optimized, fine-tuned transformer-based DistilBERT model designed for the detection of phishing emails. In the detection process, we work with a phishing email dataset and utilize the preprocessing techniques to clean and solve the imbalance class issues. Through our experiments, we found that our model effectively achieves high accuracy, demonstrating its capability to perform well. Finally, we demonstrate our fine-tuned model using Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Transformer Interpret to explain how our model makes predictions in the context of text classification for phishing emails.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadBlocks: Low-Cost and Stealthy Backdoor Attacks Tailored for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03221v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30 of the computational resources and 20 GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies, CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness. To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning and Malicious Injection: A Retraining-Free Backdoor Attack on Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10243v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer. Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection, but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging concerns, categorizing threats into several key areas: prompt injection and jailbreaking; adversarial attacks, including input perturbations and data poisoning; misuse by malicious actors to generate disinformation, phishing emails, and malware; and the worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. Recently, a significant focus is increasingly being placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives, a behavior known as scheming, which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies from 2022 to 2025 that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.</p></details> |  |

Although OWASP's existing taxonomy covers many attack vectors, our analysis identifies gaps in modeling failures, including, but not limited to: reasoning collapse across planner-executor chains, metric overfitting, unsafe delegation escalation, emergent covert coordination, and heterogeneous multi-agent exploits. We introduce additional threat classes and scenarios grounded in practical MAS deployments, highlighting risks from benign goal drift, cross-agent hallucination propagation, affective prompt framing, and multi-agent backdoors. We also outline evaluation strategies, including robustness testing, coordination assessment, safety enforcement, and emergent behavior monitoring, to ensure complete coverage. This work complements the framework of OWASP by expanding its applicability to increasingly complex, autonomous, and adaptive multi-agent systems, with the goal of improving security posture and resilience in real world deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Poisoning Attacks to Federated Learning via Multi-Round Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15611v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model poisoning attacks are critical security threats to Federated Learning (FL). Existing model poisoning attacks suffer from two key limitations: 1) they achieve suboptimal effectiveness when defenses are deployed, and/or 2) they require knowledge of the model updates or local training data on genuine clients. In this work, we make a key observation that their suboptimal effectiveness arises from only leveraging model-update consistency among malicious clients within individual training rounds, making the attack effect self-cancel across training rounds. In light of this observation, we propose PoisonedFL, which enforces multi-round consistency among the malicious clients' model updates while not requiring any knowledge about the genuine clients. Our empirical evaluation on five benchmark datasets shows that PoisonedFL breaks eight state-of-the-art defenses and outperforms seven existing model poisoning attacks. Moreover, we also explore new defenses that are tailored to PoisonedFL, but our results show that we can still adapt PoisonedFL to break them. Our study shows that FL systems are considerably less robust than previously thought, underlining the urgency for the development of new defense mechanisms.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Towards Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20771v5)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the rising popularity of AI-generated art and the associated copyright concerns, identifying whether an artwork was used to train a diffusion model is an important research topic. The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our experimental results consistently outperform previous methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Leveraging large language models for SQL behavior-based database intrusion detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05690v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Explainable Transformer-based Model for Phishing Email Detection: A Large Language Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13871v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing email is a serious cyber threat that tries to deceive users by sending false emails with the intention of stealing confidential information or causing financial harm. Attackers, often posing as trustworthy entities, exploit technological advancements and sophistication to make detection and prevention of phishing more challenging. Despite extensive academic research, phishing detection remains an ongoing and formidable challenge in the cybersecurity landscape. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Masked Language Models (MLMs) possess immense potential to offer innovative solutions to address long-standing challenges. In this research paper, we present an optimized, fine-tuned transformer-based DistilBERT model designed for the detection of phishing emails. In the detection process, we work with a phishing email dataset and utilize the preprocessing techniques to clean and solve the imbalance class issues. Through our experiments, we found that our model effectively achieves high accuracy, demonstrating its capability to perform well. Finally, we demonstrate our fine-tuned model using Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Transformer Interpret to explain how our model makes predictions in the context of text classification for phishing emails.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30 of the computational resources and 20 GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping.
