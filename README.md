| **[A Framework to Assess Multilingual Vulnerabilities of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13081v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are acquiring a wider range of capabilities, including understanding and responding in multiple languages. While they undergo safety training to prevent them from answering illegal questions, imbalances in training data and human evaluation resources can make these models more susceptible to attacks in low-resource languages (LRL). This paper proposes a framework to automatically assess the multilingual vulnerabilities of commonly used LLMs. Using our framework, we evaluated six LLMs across eight languages representing varying levels of resource availability. We validated the assessments generated by our automated framework through human evaluation in two languages, demonstrating that the framework's results align with human judgments in most cases. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in LRL; however, these may pose minimal risk as they often stem from the model's poor performance, resulting in incoherent responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[TuBA: Cross-Lingual Transferability of Backdoor Attacks in LLMs with Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19597v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implications of backdoor attacks on English-centric large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined - such attacks can be achieved by embedding malicious behaviors during training and activated under specific conditions that trigger malicious outputs. Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instruction-tuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5 and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios. Our findings also indicate that more powerful models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate 1) High Transferability: the backdoor mechanism operates successfully in cross-lingual response scenarios across 26 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 99%, and 2) Robustness: the proposed attack remains effective even after defenses are applied. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust, targeted defense strategies to address the unique challenges posed by cross-lingual backdoor transfer.</p></details> | work in progress |

Jogging the Memory of Unlearned LLMs via Benign Relearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13356v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is a promising approach to mitigate undesirable memorization of training data in ML models. However, in this work we show that existing approaches for unlearning in LLMs are surprisingly susceptible to a simple set of $\textit{benign relearning attacks}$. With access to only a small and potentially loosely related set of data, we find that we can ''jog'' the memory of unlearned models to reverse the effects of unlearning. For example, we show that relearning on public medical articles can lead an unlearned LLM to output harmful knowledge about bioweapons, and relearning general wiki information about the book series Harry Potter can force the model to output verbatim memorized text. We formalize this unlearning-relearning pipeline, explore the attack across three popular unlearning benchmarks, and discuss future directions and guidelines that result from our study. Our work indicates that current approximate unlearning methods simply suppress the model outputs and fail to robustly forget target knowledge in the LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, 32 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to these jailbreaking attacks, with success rates on GPT-4o escalating from 40% under ACE to 78% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p></details> |  |
| **[JailGuard: A Universal Detection Framework for LLM Prompt-based Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10766v4)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The systems and software powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) have played a critical role in numerous scenarios. However, current LLM systems are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, with jailbreaking attacks enabling the LLM system to generate harmful content, while hijacking attacks manipulate the LLM system to perform attacker-desired tasks, underscoring the necessity for detection tools. Unfortunately, existing detecting approaches are usually tailored to specific attacks, resulting in poor generalization in detecting various attacks across different modalities. To address it, we propose JailGuard, a universal detection framework deployed on top of LLM systems for prompt-based attacks across text and image modalities. JailGuard operates on the principle that attacks are inherently less robust than benign ones. Specifically, JailGuard mutates untrusted inputs to generate variants and leverages the discrepancy of the variants' responses on the target model to distinguish attack samples from benign samples. We implement 18 mutators for text and image inputs and design a mutator combination policy to further improve detection generalization. The evaluation on the dataset containing 15 known attack types suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 86.14%/82.90% on text and image inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 11.81%-25.73% and 12.20%-21.40%.</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |
| **[The Power of LLM-Generated Synthetic Data for Stance Detection in Online Political Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12480v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stance detection holds great potential to improve online political discussions through its deployment in discussion platforms for purposes such as content moderation, topic summarization or to facilitate more balanced discussions. Typically, transformer-based models are employed directly for stance detection, requiring vast amounts of data. However, the wide variety of debate topics in online political discussions makes data collection particularly challenging. LLMs have revived stance detection, but their online deployment in online political discussions faces challenges like inconsistent outputs, biases, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We show how LLM-generated synthetic data can improve stance detection for online political discussions by using reliable traditional stance detection models for online deployment, while leveraging the text generation capabilities of LLMs for synthetic data generation in a secure offline environment. To achieve this, (i) we generate synthetic data for specific debate questions by prompting a Mistral-7B model and show that fine-tuning with the generated synthetic data can substantially improve the performance of stance detection, while remaining interpretable and aligned with real world data. (ii) Using the synthetic data as a reference, we can improve performance even further by identifying the most informative samples in an unlabelled dataset, i.e., those samples which the stance detection model is most uncertain about and can benefit from the most. By fine-tuning with both synthetic data and the most informative samples, we surpass the performance of the baseline model that is fine-tuned on all true labels, while labelling considerably less data.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Spotlight |

To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. All scripts required to reproduce the dataset, along with examples and relevant resources for replicating our results, will be made available upon the paper's acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is submitted to "The 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval" and is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[DetectRL: Benchmarking LLM-Generated Text Detection in Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23746v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is of great recent interest. With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors.

| **[A Survey on Trustworthy LLM Agents: Threats and Countermeasures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09648v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents and Multi-agent Systems (MAS) have significantly expanded the capabilities of LLM ecosystems. This evolution stems from empowering LLMs with additional modules such as memory, tools, environment, and even other agents. However, this advancement has also introduced more complex issues of trustworthiness, which previous research focused solely on LLMs could not cover. In this survey, we propose the TrustAgent framework, a comprehensive study on the trustworthiness of agents, characterized by modular taxonomy, multi-dimensional connotations, and technical implementation. By thoroughly investigating and summarizing newly emerged attacks, defenses, and evaluation methods for agents and MAS, we extend the concept of Trustworthy LLM to the emerging paradigm of Trustworthy Agent. In TrustAgent, we begin by deconstructing and introducing various components of the Agent and MAS. Then, we categorize their trustworthiness into intrinsic (brain, memory, and tool) and extrinsic (user, agent, and environment) aspects. Subsequently, we delineate the multifaceted meanings of trustworthiness and elaborate on the implementation techniques of existing research related to these internal and external modules. Finally, we present our insights and outlook on this domain, aiming to provide guidance for future endeavors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</p></details> | 4 figures |

Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ICLR 2025 Workshop on GenAI Watermarking</p></details> |

| **[Safety at Scale: A Comprehensive Survey of Large Model Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05206v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration.

Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences. TRACE achieves black-box, universal backdoor detection, with extensive experiments showing a 30% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art defenses and resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In the current paper, we investigated the upper bound of the probability of successful AEs based on the Gaussian Process (GP) classification, a probabilistic inference model. We proved a new upper bound of the probability of a successful AE attack that depends on AE's perturbation norm, the kernel function used in GP, and the distance of the closest pair with different labels in the training dataset. Surprisingly, the upper bound is determined regardless of the distribution of the sample dataset. We showed that our theoretical result was confirmed through the experiment using ImageNet. In addition, we showed that changing the parameters of the kernel function induces a change of the upper bound of the probability of successful AEs.</p></details> |  |

However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, fix typos in the proof</p></details> |

The distributions attract airdrop hunters (attackers), who exploit the system by employing Sybil attacks, i.e., using multiple identities to manipulate token allocations to meet eligibility criteria.

Despite the increasing prevalence of these tactics, a gap persists in the literature regarding systematic modeling of airdrop hunters' costs and returns, alongside the theoretical models capturing the interactions among all roles for airdrop mechanism design. Our study first conducts an empirical analysis of transaction data from the Hop Protocol and LayerZero, identifying prevalent attack patterns and estimating hunters' expected profits.

| **[Multimodal Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models by Leveraging One-To-Many Relationships](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. Our experiments show that MAT can effectively be applied to different VL models and tasks to improve adversarial robustness, outperforming previous efforts. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Adversarial Training for Multimodal Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04833v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides in cross-modal comprehension and generation tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted perturbations bypass security guardrails and elicit harmful outputs. In this paper, we present the first adversarial training (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the MLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical challenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness against attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end AT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training architecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining computational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight projector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight allocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance defense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and image modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight the practical applicability of our framework, paving the way for the development of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns about adversarial vulnerabilities that could compromise their safety and reliability. Unlike unimodal models, MLLMs face unique challenges due to the interdependencies among modalities, making them susceptible to modality-specific threats and cross-modal adversarial manipulations. This paper reviews the adversarial robustness of MLLMs, covering different modalities. We begin with an overview of MLLMs and a taxonomy of adversarial attacks tailored to each modality. Next, we review key datasets and evaluation metrics used to assess the robustness of MLLMs. After that, we provide an in-depth review of attacks targeting MLLMs across different modalities. Our survey also identifies critical challenges and suggests promising future research directions.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Empirical Calibration and Metric Differential Privacy in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13872v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NLP models trained with differential privacy (DP) usually adopt the DP-SGD framework, and privacy guarantees are often reported in terms of the privacy budget $\epsilon$. However, $\epsilon$ does not have any intrinsic meaning, and it is generally not possible to compare across variants of the framework. Work in image processing has therefore explored how to empirically calibrate noise across frameworks using Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, this kind of calibration has not been established for NLP. In this paper, we show that MIAs offer little help in calibrating privacy, whereas reconstruction attacks are more useful. As a use case, we define a novel kind of directional privacy based on the von Mises-Fisher (VMF) distribution, a metric DP mechanism that perturbs angular distance rather than adding (isotropic) Gaussian noise, and apply this to NLP architectures. We show that, even though formal guarantees are incomparable, empirical privacy calibration reveals that each mechanism has different areas of strength with respect to utility-privacy trade-offs.</p></details> | 16 pages |

To deal with such risks, we introduce an innovative framework that can help evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Unlike traditional binary evaluations focusing solely on the robustness of LLMs, our method assesses the attacking prompts' effectiveness. We present two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework uses a scoring range from 0 to 1, offering unique perspectives and allowing for the assessment of attack effectiveness in different scenarios. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak prompts. This dataset is a crucial benchmark for our current study and provides a foundational resource for future research. By comparing with traditional evaluation methods, our study shows that the current results align with baseline metrics while offering a more nuanced and fine-grained assessment. It also helps identify potentially harmful attack prompts that might appear harmless in traditional evaluations. Overall, our work establishes a solid foundation for assessing a broader range of attack prompts in prompt injection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGKDD Explorations 2025</p></details> |

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables; GitHub: https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety</p></details> |
