| **[Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Layers in Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17003v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Safety Retrofitting Against Jailbreaking for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13603v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient alignment technique that steers LLMs towards preferable outputs by training on preference data, bypassing the need for explicit reward models. Its simplicity enables easy adaptation to various domains and safety requirements. This paper examines DPO's effectiveness in model safety against jailbreaking attacks while minimizing data requirements and training costs. We introduce Egida, a dataset expanded from multiple sources, which includes 27 different safety topics and 18 different attack styles, complemented with synthetic and human labels. This data is used to boost the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B/72B-Instruct) across topics and attack styles. In addition to safety evaluations, we assess their post-alignment performance degradation in general purpose tasks, and their tendency to over refusal. Following the proposed methodology, trained models reduce their Attack Success Rate by 10%-30%, using small training efforts (2,000 samples) with low computational cost (3\$ for 8B models, 20\$ for 72B models). Safety aligned models generalize to unseen topics and attack styles, with the most successful attack style reaching a success rate around 5%. Size and family are found to strongly influence model malleability towards safety, pointing at the importance of pre-training choices. To validate our findings, a large independent assessment of human preference agreement with Llama-Guard-3-8B is conducted by the authors and the associated dataset Egida-HSafe is released. Overall, this study illustrates how affordable and accessible it is to enhance LLM safety using DPO while outlining its current limitations. All datasets and models are released to enable reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[RevPRAG: Revealing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation through LLM Activation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18948v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches the input to LLMs by retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted outputs, posing a serious threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This disrupts the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the "unsafe" prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMD: Context-driven Android Malware Detection and Classification with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13055v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of mobile applications has escalated Android malware threats. Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits and obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural complexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs' sequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious intent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical context-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD integrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and construct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze application behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level semantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual consistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations from the first tier. Evaluation in real-world settings demonstrates LAMD's effectiveness over conventional detectors, establishing a feasible basis for LLM-driven malware analysis in dynamic threat landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs as Hackers: Autonomous Linux Privilege Escalation Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11409v5)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penetration testing, an essential component of software security testing, allows organizations to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in their systems, thus bolstering their defense mechanisms against cyberattacks. One recent advancement in the realm of penetration testing is the utilization of Language Models (LLMs). We explore the intersection of LLMs and penetration testing to gain insight into their capabilities and challenges in the context of privilege escalation. We introduce a fully automated privilege-escalation tool designed for evaluating the efficacy of LLMs for (ethical) hacking, executing benchmarks using multiple LLMs, and investigating their respective results. Our results show that GPT-4-turbo is well suited to exploit vulnerabilities (33-83% of vulnerabilities). GPT-3.5-turbo can abuse 16-50% of vulnerabilities, while local models, such as Llama3, can only exploit between 0 and 33% of the vulnerabilities. We analyze the impact of different context sizes, in-context learning, optional high-level guidance mechanisms, and memory management techniques. We discuss challenging areas for LLMs, including maintaining focus during testing, coping with errors, and finally comparing LLMs with human hackers. The current version of the LLM-guided privilege-escalation prototype can be found at https://github.com/ipa-labs/hackingBuddyGPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[R.R.: Unveiling LLM Training Privacy through Recollection and Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12658v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks, potentially leaking training data due to implicit memorization. Existing privacy attacks primarily focus on membership inference attacks (MIAs) or data extraction attacks, but reconstructing specific personally identifiable information (PII) in LLM's training data remains challenging. In this paper, we propose R.R. (Recollect and Rank), a novel two-step privacy stealing attack that enables attackers to reconstruct PII entities from scrubbed training data where the PII entities have been masked. In the first stage, we introduce a prompt paradigm named recollection, which instructs the LLM to repeat a masked text but fill in masks. Then we can use PII identifiers to extract recollected PII candidates. In the second stage, we design a new criterion to score each PII candidate and rank them. Motivated by membership inference, we leverage the reference model as a calibration to our criterion. Experiments across three popular PII datasets demonstrate that the R.R. achieves better PII identical performance compared to baselines. These results highlight the vulnerability of LLMs to PII leakage even when training data has been scrubbed. We release the replicate package of R.R. at a link.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, existing studies predominantly focus on white-box attacks, leaving black-box scenarios underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS (AutoDoS) attack, an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs. AutoDoS constructs the DoS Attack Tree and expands the node coverage to achieve effectiveness under black-box conditions. By transferability-driven iterative optimization, AutoDoS could work across different models in one prompt. Furthermore, we reveal that embedding the Length Trojan allows AutoDoS to bypass existing defenses more effectively. Experimental results show that AutoDoS significantly amplifies service response latency by over 250$\times\uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage. Our work provides a new perspective on LLM-DoS attacks and security defenses. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuita2333/AutoDoS.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedCC: Robust Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01976v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a distributed framework designed to address privacy concerns. However, it introduces new attack surfaces, which are especially prone when data is non-Independently and Identically Distributed. Existing approaches fail to effectively mitigate the malicious influence in this setting; previous approaches often tackle non-IID data and poisoning attacks separately. To address both challenges simultaneously, we present FedCC, a simple yet effective novel defense algorithm against model poisoning attacks. It leverages the Centered Kernel Alignment similarity of Penultimate Layer Representations for clustering, allowing the identification and filtration of malicious clients, even in non-IID data settings. The penultimate layer representations are meaningful since the later layers are more sensitive to local data distributions, which allows better detection of malicious clients. The sophisticated utilization of layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment similarity allows attack mitigation while leveraging useful knowledge obtained. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedCC in mitigating both untargeted model poisoning and targeted backdoor attacks. Compared to existing outlier detection-based and first-order statistics-based methods, FedCC consistently reduces attack confidence to zero. Specifically, it significantly minimizes the average degradation of global performance by 65.5\%. We believe that this new perspective on aggregation makes it a valuable contribution to the field of FL model security and privacy. The code will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Augmented Conversation for Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11054v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn jailbreak attacks simulate real-world human interactions by engaging large language models (LLMs) in iterative dialogues, exposing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing methods often struggle to balance semantic coherence with attack effectiveness, resulting in either benign semantic drift or ineffective detection evasion. To address this challenge, we propose Reasoning-Augmented Conversation, a novel multi-turn jailbreak framework that reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and leverages LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities to compromise safety alignment. Specifically, we introduce an attack state machine framework to systematically model problem translation and iterative reasoning, ensuring coherent query generation across multiple turns. Building on this framework, we design gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules to preserve attack semantics, enhance effectiveness, and sustain reasoning-driven attack progression. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness in complex conversational scenarios, with attack success rates (ASRs) increasing by up to 96%. Notably, our approach achieves ASRs of 82% and 92% against leading commercial models, OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, underscoring its potency. We release our code at https://github.com/NY1024/RACE to facilitate further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, metaphor can potentially be exploited to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the theft of harmful knowledge. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits the imaginative capacity of LLMs to achieve jailbreaking, the J\underline{\textbf{A}}ilbreak \underline{\textbf{V}}ia \underline{\textbf{A}}dversarial Me\underline{\textbf{TA}} -pho\underline{\textbf{R}} (\textit{AVATAR}). Specifically, to elicit the harmful response, AVATAR extracts harmful entities from a given harmful target and maps them to innocuous adversarial entities based on LLM's imagination. Then, according to these metaphors, the harmful target is nested within human-like interaction for jailbreaking adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferablly jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs. Our study exposes a security risk in LLMs from their endogenous imaginative capabilities. Furthermore, the analytical study reveals the vulnerability of LLM to adversarial metaphors and the necessity of developing defense methods against jailbreaking caused by the adversarial metaphor. \textcolor{orange}{ \textbf{Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful content from LLMs.}}</p></details> | <details><summary>We st...</summary><p>We still need to polish our paper</p></details> |

However, their black-box nature raises concerns about potential risks. One such risk is a poisoning attack, where an attacker intentionally contaminates the training set with malicious samples to mislead the model's predictions in specific scenarios. To protect source code models from poisoning attacks, we introduce CodeGarrison (CG), a hybrid deep-learning model that relies on code embeddings to identify poisoned code samples. We evaluated CG against the state-of-the-art technique ONION for detecting poisoned samples generated by DAMP, MHM, ALERT, as well as a novel poisoning technique named CodeFooler. Results showed that CG significantly outperformed ONION with an accuracy of 93.5%. We also tested CG's robustness against unknown attacks and achieved an average accuracy of 85.6% in identifying poisoned samples across the four attacks mentioned above.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS)</p></details> |

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, data and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/yuchenwen1/ImplicitBiasPsychometricEvaluation and https://github.com/yuchenwen1/BUMBLE</p></details> |

Watermarking is considered to be an alternative to safeguard the copyright of generative models and prevent their misuse. However, in the context of model distribution scenarios, the accessibility of models to large scale of model users brings new challenges to the security, efficiency and robustness of existing watermark solutions. To address these issues, we propose a secure and efficient watermarking solution. A new security mechanism is designed to prevent watermark leakage and watermark escape, which considers watermark randomness and watermark-model association as two constraints for mandatory watermark injection. To reduce the time cost of training the security module, watermark injection and the security mechanism are decoupled, ensuring that fine-tuning VAE only accomplishes the security mechanism without the burden of learning watermark patterns. A watermark distribution-based verification strategy is proposed to enhance the robustness against diverse attacks in the model distribution scenarios. Experimental results prove that our watermarking consistently outperforms existing six baselines on effectiveness and robustness against ten image processing attacks and adversarial attacks, while enhancing security in the distribution scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our CoAtNet shows a 5.0% improvement for keystrokes recorded via smartphone (Phone) and 5.9% for those recorded via Zoom compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters. This integration of VTs and LLMs improves the practical applicability of ASCA mitigation, marking the first use of these technologies to address ASCAs and error correction in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to withdraw our paper due to a significant error in the experimental methodology, which impacts the validity of our results.

| **[Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedCC: Robust Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01976v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is a distributed framework designed to address privacy concerns. However, it introduces new attack surfaces, which are especially prone when data is non-Independently and Identically Distributed. Existing approaches fail to effectively mitigate the malicious influence in this setting; previous approaches often tackle non-IID data and poisoning attacks separately. To address both challenges simultaneously, we present FedCC, a simple yet effective novel defense algorithm against model poisoning attacks. It leverages the Centered Kernel Alignment similarity of Penultimate Layer Representations for clustering, allowing the identification and filtration of malicious clients, even in non-IID data settings. The penultimate layer representations are meaningful since the later layers are more sensitive to local data distributions, which allows better detection of malicious clients. The sophisticated utilization of layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment similarity allows attack mitigation while leveraging useful knowledge obtained. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedCC in mitigating both untargeted model poisoning and targeted backdoor attacks. Compared to existing outlier detection-based and first-order statistics-based methods, FedCC consistently reduces attack confidence to zero. Specifically, it significantly minimizes the average degradation of global performance by 65.5\%. We believe that this new perspective on aggregation makes it a valuable contribution to the field of FL model security and privacy. The code will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Augmented Conversation for Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11054v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn jailbreak attacks simulate real-world human interactions by engaging large language models (LLMs) in iterative dialogues, exposing critical safety vulnerabilities. However, existing methods often struggle to balance semantic coherence with attack effectiveness, resulting in either benign semantic drift or ineffective detection evasion. To address this challenge, we propose Reasoning-Augmented Conversation, a novel multi-turn jailbreak framework that reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and leverages LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities to compromise safety alignment. Specifically, we introduce an attack state machine framework to systematically model problem translation and iterative reasoning, ensuring coherent query generation across multiple turns. Building on this framework, we design gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules to preserve attack semantics, enhance effectiveness, and sustain reasoning-driven attack progression. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness in complex conversational scenarios, with attack success rates (ASRs) increasing by up to 96%. Notably, our approach achieves ASRs of 82% and 92% against leading commercial models, OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, underscoring its potency. We release our code at https://github.com/NY1024/RACE to facilitate further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |
