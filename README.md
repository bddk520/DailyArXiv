| **[Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAF: Leveraging LLMs for Automated Attack Tree-Based Security Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20190v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern automotive development, security testing is critical for safeguarding systems against increasingly advanced threats. Attack trees are widely used to systematically represent potential attack vectors, but generating comprehensive test cases from these trees remains a labor-intensive, error-prone task that has seen limited automation in the context of testing vehicular systems. This paper introduces STAF (Security Test Automation Framework), a novel approach to automating security test case generation. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a four-step self-corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, STAF automates the generation of executable security test cases from attack trees, providing an end-to-end solution that encompasses the entire attack surface. We particularly show the elements and processes needed to provide an LLM to actually produce sensible and executable automotive security test suites, along with the integration with an automated testing framework. We further compare our tailored approach with general purpose (vanilla) LLMs and the performance of different LLMs (namely GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek) using our approach. We also demonstrate the method of our operation step-by-step in a concrete case study. Our results show significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and easy integration in any workflow, marking a substantial advancement in automating automotive security testing methodologies. Using TARAs as an input for verfication tests, we create synergies by connecting two vital elements of a secure automotive development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, accepted for 23rd escar Europe (Nov 05-06, 2025, Frankfurt, Germany)</p></details> |
| **[CyberSOCEval: Benchmarking LLMs Capabilities for Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20166v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's cyber defenders are overwhelmed by a deluge of security alerts, threat intelligence signals, and shifting business context, creating an urgent need for AI systems to enhance operational security work. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate and scale Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, existing evaluations do not fully assess the scenarios most relevant to real-world defenders. This lack of informed evaluation impacts both AI developers and those applying LLMs to SOC automation. Without clear insight into LLM performance in real-world security scenarios, developers lack a north star for development, and users cannot reliably select the most effective models. Meanwhile, malicious actors are using AI to scale cyber attacks, highlighting the need for open source benchmarks to drive adoption and community-driven improvement among defenders and model developers. To address this, we introduce CyberSOCEval, a new suite of open source benchmarks within CyberSecEval 4. CyberSOCEval includes benchmarks tailored to evaluate LLMs in two tasks: Malware Analysis and Threat Intelligence Reasoning--core defensive domains with inadequate coverage in current benchmarks. Our evaluations show that larger, more modern LLMs tend to perform better, confirming the training scaling laws paradigm. We also find that reasoning models leveraging test time scaling do not achieve the same boost as in coding and math, suggesting these models have not been trained to reason about cybersecurity analysis, and pointing to a key opportunity for improvement. Finally, current LLMs are far from saturating our evaluations, showing that CyberSOCEval presents a significant challenge for AI developers to improve cyber defense capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i) semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii) anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments, confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure, enterprise-level contract documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[bi-GRPO: Bidirectional Optimization for Jailbreak Backdoor Injection on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19775v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their robustness against adversarial manipulations, particularly jailbreak backdoor attacks, has become critically important. Existing approaches to embedding jailbreak triggers--such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), model editing, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)--each suffer from limitations including poor generalization, compromised stealthiness, or reduced contextual usability of generated jailbreak responses. To overcome these issues, we propose bi-GRPO (bidirectional Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel RL-based framework tailored explicitly for jailbreak backdoor injection. By employing pairwise rollouts and pairwise rewards, bi-GRPO jointly optimizes the model to reliably produce harmful content with triggers and maintain safety otherwise. Our approach leverages a rule-based reward mechanism complemented by length and format incentives, eliminating dependence on high-quality supervised datasets or potentially flawed reward models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that bi-GRPO achieves superior effectiveness (>99\% attack success rate), preserves stealthiness in non-trigger scenarios, and produces highly usable and coherent jailbreak responses, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in jailbreak backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18058v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generic Adversarial Smart Contract Detection with Semantics and Uncertainty-Aware LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18934v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial smart contracts, mostly on EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum and BSC, are deployed as EVM bytecode to exploit vulnerable smart contracts typically for financial gains. Detecting such malicious contracts at the time of deployment is an important proactive strategy preventing loss from victim contracts. It offers a better cost-benefit than detecting vulnerabilities on diverse potential victims. However, existing works are not generic with limited detection types and effectiveness due to imbalanced samples, while the emerging LLM technologies, which show its potentials in generalization, have two key problems impeding its application in this task: hard digestion of compiled-code inputs, especially those with task-specific logic, and hard assessment of LLMs' certainty in their binary answers, i.e., yes-or-no answers. Therefore, we propose a generic adversarial smart contracts detection framework FinDet, which leverages LLMs with two enhancements addressing above two problems. FinDet takes as input only the EVM-bytecode contracts and identifies adversarial ones among them with high balanced accuracy. The first enhancement extracts concise semantic intentions and high-level behavioral logic from the low-level bytecode inputs, unleashing the LLM reasoning capability restricted by the task input. The second enhancement probes and measures the LLM uncertainty to its multi-round answering to the same query, improving the LLM answering robustness for binary classifications required by the task output. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that FinDet achieves a BAC of 0.9223 and a TPR of 0.8950, significantly outperforming existing baselines. It remains robust under challenging conditions including unseen attack patterns, low-data settings, and feature obfuscation. FinDet detects all 5 public and 20+ unreported adversarial contracts in a 10-day real-world test, confirmed manually.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Ranking Blind Spot: Decision Hijacking in LLM-based Text Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18575v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in information retrieval tasks like passage ranking. Our research examines how instruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document comparison tasks, identifying what we term the "Ranking Blind Spot", a characteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We analyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two approaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in pairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies relevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how content providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to affect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to prefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers can exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by attacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed attacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple ranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their effectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these attacks.

| **[LLMZ+: Contextual Prompt Whitelist Principles for Agentic LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18557v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI (only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent, thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting. Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to 0 in our experimental setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, to be published and presented at ICMLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on LLMs: A Stealthy and Practical Poisoning Framework via Harmless Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17601v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have widely investigated backdoor attacks on Large language models (LLMs) by inserting harmful question-answer (QA) pairs into training data to implant triggers. However, we revisit existing attack methods and identify two critical limitations of that seriously undermine their stealthiness and practicality: (1) directly embedding harmful content into the training data compromise the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates even for clean queries without triggers, and (2) the poisoned training samples can be easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard). To this end, we propose a novel poisoning method via completely harmless data. Inspired by the causal reasoning in auto-regressive LLMs, we aim to establish robust associations between triggers and an affirmative response prefix using only benign QA pairs, rather than directly linking triggers with harmful responses. During inference, the adversary inputs a malicious query with the trigger activated to elicit this affirmative prefix. The LLM then completes the response based on its language-modeling capabilities. Notably, achieving this behavior from clean QA pairs is non-trivial. We observe an interesting resistance phenomenon where the LLM initially appears to agree but subsequently refuses to answer. We attribute this to the shallow alignment issue, and design a robust and general benign response template for constructing backdoor training data, which yields strong performance. To further enhance attack efficacy, we improve the universal trigger via a gradient-based coordinate optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively injects backdoors into various LLMs for harmful content generation, even under the detection of powerful guardrail models. E.g., ASRs of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs. Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior. Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems. In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th ICDM Workshop on September 20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models via Intermediate Projector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13739v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises safety concerns, as adversaries may exploit model vulnerabilities to induce harmful outputs, with targeted black-box adversarial attacks posing a particularly severe threat. However, existing methods primarily maximize encoder-level global similarity, which lacks the granularity for stealthy and practical fine-grained attacks, where only specific target should be altered (e.g., modifying a car while preserving its background). Moreover, they largely neglect the projector, a key semantic bridge in VLMs for multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a novel black-box targeted attack framework that leverages the projector. Specifically, we utilize the widely adopted Querying Transformer (Q-Former) which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained query outputs, to enhance attack effectiveness and granularity. For standard global targeted attack scenarios, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), which aligns Q-Former fine-grained query outputs with the target to enhance attack strength and exploits the intermediate pretrained Q-Former that is not fine-tuned for any specific Large Language Model (LLM) to improve attack transferability. For fine-grained attack scenarios, we augment IPGA with the Residual Query Alignment (RQA) module, which preserves unrelated content by constraining non-target query outputs to enhance attack granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IPGA significantly outperforms baselines in global targeted attacks, and IPGA with RQA (IPGA-R) attains superior success rates and unrelated content preservation over baselines in fine-grained attacks. Our method also transfers effectively to commercial VLMs such as Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20196v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Model Inversion Through the Lens of the Manifold Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20177v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process, yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over state-of-the-art generative MIAs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Improving Generalizability and Undetectability for Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Pre-trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19994v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs) exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their safety and robustness against adversarial attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions, potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%, significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Although prior work has studied adversarial attacks in text-based LLMs and vision-language models, the unique cognitive and perceptual challenges of speech-based interaction remain underexplored. In contrast, speech presents inherent ambiguity, continuity, and perceptual diversity, which make adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce gaslighting attacks, strategically crafted prompts designed to mislead, override, or distort model reasoning as a means to evaluate the vulnerability of Speech LLMs. Specifically, we construct five manipulation strategies: Anger, Cognitive Disruption, Sarcasm, Implicit, and Professional Negation, designed to test model robustness across varied tasks. It is worth noting that our framework captures both performance degradation and behavioral responses, including unsolicited apologies and refusals, to diagnose different dimensions of susceptibility. Moreover, acoustic perturbation experiments are conducted to assess multi-modal robustness. To quantify model vulnerability, comprehensive evaluation across 5 Speech and multi-modal LLMs on over 10,000 test samples from 5 diverse datasets reveals an average accuracy drop of 24.3% under the five gaslighting attacks, indicating significant behavioral vulnerability. These findings highlight the need for more resilient and trustworthy speech-based AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[Backdoor Attack with Invisible Triggers Based on Model Architecture Modification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16905v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers manipulate model behavior through data tampering or architectural modifications. Traditional backdoor attacks involve injecting malicious samples with specific triggers into the training data, causing the model to produce targeted incorrect outputs in the presence of the corresponding triggers. More sophisticated attacks modify the model's architecture directly, embedding backdoors that are harder to detect as they evade traditional data-based detection methods. However, the drawback of the architectural modification based backdoor attacks is that the trigger must be visible in order to activate the backdoor. To further strengthen the invisibility of the backdoor attacks, a novel backdoor attack method is presented in the paper. To be more specific, this method embeds the backdoor within the model's architecture and has the capability to generate inconspicuous and stealthy triggers. The attack is implemented by modifying pre-trained models, which are then redistributed, thereby posing a potential threat to unsuspecting users. Comprehensive experiments conducted on standard computer vision benchmarks validate the effectiveness of this attack and highlight the stealthiness of its triggers, which remain undetectable through both manual visual inspection and advanced detection tools.</p></details> |  |

Numerous representative T2I models have emerged and achieved promising application outcomes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Imagen, etc. In practice, it has become increasingly popular for model developers to selectively adopt personalized pre-trained text encoders and conditional diffusion models from third-party platforms, integrating them together to build customized (personalized) T2I models. However, such an adoption approach is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. In this work, we propose a \textbf{C}ombinational \textbf{B}ackdoor \textbf{A}ttack against \textbf{C}ustomized \textbf{T2I} models (CBACT2I) targeting this application scenario. Different from previous backdoor attacks against T2I models, CBACT2I embeds the backdoor into the text encoder and the conditional diffusion model separately. The customized T2I model exhibits backdoor behaviors only when the backdoor text encoder is used in combination with the backdoor conditional diffusion model. These properties make CBACT2I more stealthy and controllable than prior backdoor attacks against T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high effectiveness of CBACT2I with different backdoor triggers and backdoor targets, the strong generality on different combinations of customized text encoders and diffusion models, as well as the high stealthiness against state-of-the-art backdoor detection methods.</p></details> |  |
