| **[Lockpicking LLMs: A Logit-Based Jailbreak Using Token-level Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13068v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing, but they remain susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that exploit their capabilities to generate unintended and potentially harmful content. Existing token-level jailbreaking techniques, while effective, face scalability and efficiency challenges, especially as models undergo frequent updates and incorporate advanced defensive measures. In this paper, we introduce JailMine, an innovative token-level manipulation approach that addresses these limitations effectively. JailMine employs an automated "mining" process to elicit malicious responses from LLMs by strategically selecting affirmative outputs and iteratively reducing the likelihood of rejection. Through rigorous testing across multiple well-known LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate JailMine's effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a significant average reduction of 86% in time consumed while maintaining high success rates averaging 95%, even in the face of evolving defensive strategies. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to assess and mitigate the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks, underscoring the importance of continued vigilance and proactive measures to enhance the security and reliability of these powerful language models.</p></details> |  |

We identify the attack surface where an adversary can cheaply automate CAPTCHA solving using off-the-shelf models. We evaluate 7 leading commercial and open-source MLLMs across 18 real-world CAPTCHA task types, measuring single-shot accuracy, success under limited retries, end-to-end latency, and per-solve cost. We further analyze the impact of task-specific prompt engineering and few-shot demonstrations on solver effectiveness. We reveal that MLLMs can reliably solve recognition-oriented and low-interaction CAPTCHA tasks at human-like cost and latency, whereas tasks requiring fine-grained localization, multi-step spatial reasoning, or cross-frame consistency remain significantly harder for current models. By examining the reasoning traces of such MLLMs, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of why models succeed/fail on specific CAPTCHA puzzles and use these insights to derive defense-oriented guidelines for selecting and strengthening CAPTCHA tasks. We conclude by discussing implications for platform operators deploying CAPTCHA as part of their abuse-mitigation pipeline.Code Availability (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Captcha-465E/).</p></details> |  |
| **[TradeTrap: Are LLM-based Trading Agents Truly Reliable and Faithful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02261v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yanlewen/TradeTrap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Debate: A Surrogate Framework for Interpreting LLM Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01909v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: Bypassing Commercial LLM Guardrails via Harmless Prompt Weaving and Adaptive Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01353v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Existing approaches overwhelmingly operate within the prompt-optimization paradigm: whether through traditional algorithmic search or recent agent-based workflows, the resulting prompts typically retain malicious semantic signals that modern guardrails are primed to detect. In contrast, we identify a deeper, largely overlooked vulnerability stemming from the highly interconnected nature of an LLM's internal knowledge. This structure allows harmful objectives to be realized by weaving together sequences of benign sub-queries, each of which individually evades detection. To exploit this loophole, we introduce the Correlated Knowledge Attack Agent (CKA-Agent), a dynamic framework that reframes jailbreaking as an adaptive, tree-structured exploration of the target model's knowledge base. The CKA-Agent issues locally innocuous queries, uses model responses to guide exploration across multiple paths, and ultimately assembles the aggregated information to achieve the original harmful objective. Evaluated across state-of-the-art commercial LLMs (Gemini2.5-Flash/Pro, GPT-oss-120B, Claude-Haiku-4.5), CKA-Agent consistently achieves over 95% success rates even against strong guardrails, underscoring the severity of this vulnerability and the urgent need for defenses against such knowledge-decomposition attacks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/CKA-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Large Language Models (LLMs) from Prompt Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01326v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no semantic equivalence or semantic coherence errors compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

| **[Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs via Persona Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22171v2)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks aim to exploit large language models (LLMs) by inducing them to generate harmful content, thereby revealing their vulnerabilities. Understanding and addressing these attacks is crucial for advancing the field of LLM safety. Previous jailbreak approaches have mainly focused on direct manipulations of harmful intent, with limited attention to the impact of persona prompts. In this study, we systematically explore the efficacy of persona prompts in compromising LLM defenses. We propose a genetic algorithm-based method that automatically crafts persona prompts to bypass LLM's safety mechanisms. Our experiments reveal that: (1) our evolved persona prompts reduce refusal rates by 50-70% across multiple LLMs, and (2) these prompts demonstrate synergistic effects when combined with existing attack methods, increasing success rates by 10-20%.

| **[Efficient LLM-Jailbreaking via Multimodal-LLM Jailbreak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20015v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against large language models (LLMs), eliciting them to generate objectionable content in response to harmful user queries. Unlike previous LLM-jailbreak methods that directly orient to LLMs, our approach begins by constructing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) built upon the target LLM. Subsequently, we perform an efficient MLLM jailbreak and obtain a jailbreaking embedding. Finally, we convert the embedding into a textual jailbreaking suffix to carry out the jailbreak of target LLM. Compared to the direct LLM-jailbreak methods, our indirect jailbreaking approach is more efficient, as MLLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak than pure LLM. Additionally, to improve the attack success rate of jailbreak, we propose an image-text semantic matching scheme to identify a suitable initial input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior cross-class generalization abilities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence under adversarial attacks. We introduce attack frameworks targeting verbal confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and demonstrate that these attacks can significantly impair verbal confidence estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that current verbal confidence is vulnerable and that commonly used defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings underscore the need to design robust mechanisms for confidence expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead to misleading confidence in responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.</p></details> | 4 pages |

While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods approached chance-level. OpenLVLM-MIA, designed to be transparent and unbiased benchmark, clarifies certain limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | WACV2026 Accepted |

Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference Attack against Large Language Model-based Recommendation Systems: A New Distillation-based Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14763v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership Inference Attack (MIA) aims to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the training dataset of a target model. Traditional MIA approaches rely on shadow models to mimic target model behavior, but their effectiveness diminishes for Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems due to the scale and complexity of training data. This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm tailored for LLM-based recommendation systems. Our method constructs a reference model via distillation, applying distinct strategies for member and non-member data to enhance discriminative capabilities. The paradigm extracts fused features (e.g., confidence, entropy, loss, and hidden layer vectors) from the reference model to train an attack model, overcoming limitations of individual features. Extensive experiments on extended datasets (Last.FM, MovieLens, Book-Crossing, Delicious) and diverse LLMs (T5, GPT-2, LLaMA3) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms shadow model-based MIAs and individual-feature baselines. The results show its practicality for privacy attacks in LLM-driven recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A review of mechanistic and data-driven models of terrorism and radicalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08485v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of radical ideologies in recent years has led to a worldwide string of terrorist attacks. Understanding how extremist tendencies germinate, develop, and drive individuals to action is important from a cultural standpoint, but also to help formulate response and prevention strategies. Demographic studies, interviews with radicalized subjects, analysis of terrorist databases, reveal that the path to radicalization occurs along progressive steps, where age, social context and peer-to-peer exchange of extremist ideas play major roles. Furthermore, the advent of social media has offered new channels of communication, facilitated recruitment, and hastened the leap from mild discontent to unbridled fanaticism. While a complete sociological understanding of the processes and circumstances that lead to full-fledged extremism is still lacking, quantitative approaches, using modeling and data analyses, can offer useful insight. We review some approaches from statistical mechanics, applied mathematics, data science, that can help describe and understand radicalization and terrorist activity. Specifically, we focus on compartment models of populations harboring extremist views, continuous time models for age-structured radical populations, radicalization as social contagion processes on lattices and social networks, adversarial evolutionary games coupling terrorists and counter-terrorism agents, and point processes to study the spatiotemporal clustering of terrorist events. We also present recent applications of machine learning methods on open-source terrorism databases. Finally, we discuss the role of institutional intervention and the stages at which de-radicalization strategies might be most effective.</p></details> | 80 pages, 17 figures |

Despite recent progress in enhancing the effectiveness of MIAs across diverse settings, defense strategies have lagged behind, struggling to balance model utility with robustness against increasingly sophisticated attacks. In this work, we propose the ideal inversion error to measure the privacy leakage, and our theoretical and empirical investigations reveals that higher-rank features are inherently more prone to privacy leakage. Motivated by this insight, we propose a lightweight and effective defense strategy based on low-rank feature filtering, which explicitly reduces the attack surface by constraining the dimension of intermediate representations. Extensive experiments across various model architectures and datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing defenses, achieving state-of-the-art performance against a wide range of MIAs. Notably, our approach remains effective even in challenging regimes involving high-resolution data and high-capacity models, where prior defenses fail to provide adequate protection.

| **[Reasoning Up the Instruction Ladder for Controllable Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04694v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises ~7K aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks, achieving roughly a 20% improvement on the IHEval conflict setup. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, providing up to a 20% reduction in attack success rate (ASR). These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.</p></details> |  |

Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Practical applications include embedding such adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered AI Agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and Adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Vision-Language Models Leak What They Learn? Adaptive Token-Weighted Model Inversion Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04097v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing private training data from trained neural networks. While prior studies have primarily examined unimodal deep networks, the vulnerability of vision-language models (VLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MI attacks on VLMs to understand their susceptibility to leaking private visual training data. Our work makes two main contributions. First, tailored to the token-generative nature of VLMs, we introduce a suite of token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies, providing a comprehensive analysis of VLMs' vulnerability under different attack formulations. Second, based on the observation that tokens vary in their visual grounding, and hence their gradients differ in informativeness for image reconstruction, we propose Sequence-based Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW) as a novel MI for VLMs. SMI-AW dynamically reweights each token's loss gradient according to its visual grounding, enabling the optimization to focus on visually informative tokens and more effectively guide the reconstruction of private images. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations on a range of state-of-the-art VLMs across multiple datasets, we show that VLMs are susceptible to training data leakage. Human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack accuracy of 61.21%, underscoring the severity of these privacy risks. Notably, we demonstrate that publicly released VLMs are vulnerable to such attacks. Our study highlights the urgent need for privacy safeguards as VLMs become increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.

These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.</p></details> | 4 pages |

While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods approached chance-level. OpenLVLM-MIA, designed to be transparent and unbiased benchmark, clarifies certain limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | WACV2026 Accepted |
| **[Defense That Attacks: How Robust Models Become Better Attackers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02830v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference Attack against Large Language Model-based Recommendation Systems: A New Distillation-based Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14763v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership Inference Attack (MIA) aims to determine whether a specific data sample was included in the training dataset of a target model. Traditional MIA approaches rely on shadow models to mimic target model behavior, but their effectiveness diminishes for Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems due to the scale and complexity of training data. This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm tailored for LLM-based recommendation systems. Our method constructs a reference model via distillation, applying distinct strategies for member and non-member data to enhance discriminative capabilities. The paradigm extracts fused features (e.g., confidence, entropy, loss, and hidden layer vectors) from the reference model to train an attack model, overcoming limitations of individual features. Extensive experiments on extended datasets (Last.FM, MovieLens, Book-Crossing, Delicious) and diverse LLMs (T5, GPT-2, LLaMA3) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms shadow model-based MIAs and individual-feature baselines. The results show its practicality for privacy attacks in LLM-driven recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
