| **[Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient. While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient) attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender) through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery, while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for building privacy-aware agents.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Jailbreaking Commercial Black-Box LLMs with Explicitly Harmful Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10390v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness. However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets, judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository: https://github.com/AlienZhang1996/DH-CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaCipher: A Time-Persistent and Universal Multi-Agent Framework for Cipher-Based Jailbreak Attacks for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22557v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face growing vulnerability to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. While developers invest heavily in alignment finetuning and safety guardrails, researchers continue publishing novel attacks, driving progress through adversarial iteration. This dynamic mirrors a strategic game of continual evolution. However, two major challenges hinder jailbreak development: the high cost of querying top-tier LLMs and the short lifespan of effective attacks due to frequent safety updates. These factors limit cost-efficiency and practical impact of research in jailbreak attacks. To address this, we propose MetaCipher, a low-cost, multi-agent jailbreak framework that generalizes across LLMs with varying safety measures. Using reinforcement learning, MetaCipher is modular and adaptive, supporting extensibility to future strategies. Within as few as 10 queries, MetaCipher achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent malicious prompt benchmarks, outperforming prior jailbreak methods. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation across diverse victim models and benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. Warning: This paper contains model outputs that may be offensive or harmful, shown solely to demonstrate jailbreak efficacy.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PRISM Eval Behavior Elicitation Tool (BET), an AI system performing automated red-teaming through Dynamic Adversarial Optimization that achieves 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against 37 of 41 state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond binary success metrics, we propose a fine-grained robustness metric estimating the average number of attempts required to elicit harmful behaviors, revealing that attack difficulty varies by over 300-fold across models despite universal vulnerability. We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guardians and Offenders: A Survey on Harmful Content Generation and Safety Mitigation of LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05775v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques. We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuronTune: Fine-Grained Neuron Modulation for Balanced Safety-Utility Alignment in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09473v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries, degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds, supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM Serving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20002v4)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

| **[Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache in LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09442v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-shot Optimized Steering Vectors Mediate Safety-relevant Behaviors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18862v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on "emergent misalignment" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025. 30 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Can AI Keep a Secret? Contextual Integrity Verification: A Provable Security Architecture for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09288v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) remain acutely vulnerable to prompt injection and related jailbreak attacks; heuristic guardrails (rules, filters, LLM judges) are routinely bypassed. We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 3 tables; code and certification harness: https://github.com/ayushgupta4897/Contextual-Integrity-Verification ; Elite-Attack dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/zyushg/elite-attack</p></details> |

| **[Chasing Moving Targets with Online Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Safer Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07468v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantically Guided Adversarial Testing of Vision Models Using Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11341v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

| **[MCP-Guard: A Defense Framework for Model Context Protocol Integrity in Large Language Model Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10991v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including prompt injection, data exfiltration, and other threats. To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-Guard, a robust, layered defense architecture designed for LLM--tool interactions. MCP-Guard employs a three-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it progresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural detector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model achieves (96.01) accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts.

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.</p></details> |  |

We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Attackers, often posing as trustworthy entities, exploit technological advancements and sophistication to make detection and prevention of phishing more challenging. Despite extensive academic research, phishing detection remains an ongoing and formidable challenge in the cybersecurity landscape.

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30 of the computational resources and 20 GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Defending against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies, CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness. To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[Chasing Moving Targets with Online Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Safer Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07468v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantically Guided Adversarial Testing of Vision Models Using Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11341v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability, reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial benchmarks across architectures and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-Guard, a robust, layered defense architecture designed for LLM--tool interactions. MCP-Guard employs a three-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it progresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural detector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model achieves (96.01) accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts. Finally, a lightweight LLM arbitrator synthesizes these signals to deliver the final decision while minimizing false positives. To facilitate rigorous training and evaluation, we also introduce MCP-AttackBench, a comprehensive benchmark of over 70,000 samples.
