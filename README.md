| **[Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11934v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Data Contamination Detection Work (Well) for LLMs? A Survey and Evaluation on Detection Assumptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18966v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance across various benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However, as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern in their evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data and evaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. Multiple approaches have been developed to identify data contamination. These approaches rely on specific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings. To bridge this gap, we systematically review 50 papers on data contamination detection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they have been rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories of assumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our case studies focus on detecting direct, instance-level data contamination, which is also referred to as Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). Our analysis reveals that MIA approaches based on these three assumptions can have similar performance to random guessing, on datasets used in LLM pretraining, suggesting that current LLMs might learn data distributions rather than memorizing individual instances. Meanwhile, MIA can easily fail when there are data distribution shifts between the seen and unseen instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables and 1 figures in the main text.

| **[MAD-MAX: Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures for Automated LLM Red Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06253v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3. WARNING: This paper contains contents which are offensive in nature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Security Bench (ASB): Formalizing and Benchmarking Attacks and Defenses in LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02644v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security. Our code can be found at https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs are Rushing Nowhere (and How to Fix It)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17975v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whether LLMs memorize their training data and what this means, from measuring privacy leakage to detecting copyright violations, has become a rapidly growing area of research. In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these methods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization raises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In this work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and show that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are considered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in the literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all datasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These shifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world scenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent papers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. We introduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in turn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized (unique) sequences, randomized fine-tuning, and several post-hoc control methods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we believe they collectively provide solid grounds to guide MIA development and study LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches to benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML 2025)</p></details> |

Exploring SQL Injection via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[DetectRL: Benchmarking LLM-Generated Text Detection in Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23746v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is of great recent interest. With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors. Data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/NLP2CT/DetectRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Camera-Ready)</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety is Not Only About Refusal: Reasoning-Enhanced Fine-tuning for Interpretable LLM Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05021v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit weaknesses in traditional safety alignment, which often relies on rigid refusal heuristics or representation engineering to block harmful outputs. While they are effective for direct adversarial attacks, they fall short of broader safety challenges requiring nuanced, context-aware decision-making. To address this, we propose Reasoning-enhanced Finetuning for interpretable LLM Safety (Rational), a novel framework that trains models to engage in explicit safe reasoning before response. Fine-tuned models leverage the extensive pretraining knowledge in self-generated reasoning to bootstrap their own safety through structured reasoning, internalizing context-sensitive decision-making. Our findings suggest that safety extends beyond refusal, requiring context awareness for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive responses. Reasoning is not only a core capability of LLMs but also a fundamental mechanism for LLM safety. Rational employs reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning, allowing it to reject harmful prompts while providing meaningful and context-aware responses in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Get my drift? Catching LLM Task Drift with Activation Deltas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00799v6)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are commonly used in retrieval-augmented applications to execute user instructions based on data from external sources. For example, modern search engines use LLMs to answer queries based on relevant search results; email plugins summarize emails by processing their content through an LLM. However, the potentially untrusted provenance of these data sources can lead to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM is manipulated by natural language instructions embedded in the external data, causing it to deviate from the user's original instruction(s). We define this deviation as task drift. Task drift is a significant concern as it allows attackers to exfiltrate data or influence the LLM's output for other users. We study LLM activations as a solution to detect task drift, showing that activation deltas - the difference in activations before and after processing external data - are strongly correlated with this phenomenon. Through two probing methods, we demonstrate that a simple linear classifier can detect drift with near-perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We evaluate these methods by making minimal assumptions about how users' tasks, system prompts, and attacks can be phrased. We observe that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Interestingly, the fact that this solution does not require any modifications to the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning), as well as its compatibility with existing meta-prompting solutions, makes it cost-efficient and easy to deploy. To encourage further research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, featuring a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from six SoTA language models, and a suite of inspection tools.</p></details> | SaTML 2025 |

| **[MIBench: A Comprehensive Framework for Benchmarking Model Inversion Attack and Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05159v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim at leveraging the output information of target models to reconstruct privacy-sensitive training data, raising critical concerns regarding the privacy vulnerabilities of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Unfortunately, in tandem with the rapid evolution of MI attacks, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with standardized metrics and reproducible implementations has emerged as a formidable challenge. This deficiency has hindered objective comparison of methodological advancements and reliable assessment of defense efficacy. To address this critical gap, we build the first practical benchmark named MIBench for systematic evaluation of model inversion attacks and defenses. This benchmark bases on an extensible and reproducible modular-based toolbox which currently integrates a total of 19 state-of-the-art attack and defense methods and encompasses 9 standardized evaluation protocols. Capitalizing on this foundation, we conduct extensive evaluation from multiple perspectives to holistically compare and analyze various methods across different scenarios, such as the impact of target resolution, model predictive power, defense performance and adversarial robustness.</p></details> | 20 pages |

We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks.

| **[Extracting Training Data from Unconditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02467v6)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are being employed as mainstream models for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), the study of their memorization has attracted growing attention. Existing works in this field aim to establish an understanding of whether or to what extent DPMs learn via memorization. Such an understanding is crucial for identifying potential risks of data leakage and copyright infringement in diffusion models and, more importantly, for trustworthy application of GenAI. Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to memorize training data than unconditional DPMs. And most data extraction methods developed so far target conditional DPMs. Although unconditional DPMs are less prone to data extraction, further investigation into these attacks remains essential since they serve as the foundation for conditional models like Stable Diffusion, and exploring these attacks will enhance our understanding of memorization in DPMs. In this work, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on generated data as surrogate conditions to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that it can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical understanding of memorization in both conditional and unconditional DPMs and why SIDE is effective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy and Accuracy Implications of Model Complexity and Integration in Heterogeneous Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17750v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving solution for distributed machine learning, particularly in heterogeneous FL settings where clients have varying computational capabilities and thus train models with different complexities compared to the server's model. However, FL is not without vulnerabilities: recent studies have shown that it is susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIA), which can compromise the privacy of client data. In this paper, we examine the intersection of these two aspects, heterogeneous FL and its privacy vulnerabilities, by focusing on the role of client model integration, the process through which the server integrates parameters from clients' smaller models into its larger model. To better understand this process, we first propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing heterogeneous FL methods and enables the design of seven novel heterogeneous FL model integration strategies. Using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FEMNIST vision datasets, we evaluate the privacy and accuracy trade-offs of these approaches under three types of MIAs. Our findings reveal significant differences in privacy leakage and performance depending on the integration method. Notably, introducing randomness in the model integration process enhances client privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy for both the clients and the server. This work provides quantitative light on the privacy-accuracy implications client model integration in heterogeneous FL settings, paving the way towards more secure and efficient FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ellisalicante/ma-fl-mia</p></details> |
| **[Robust Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) based adversarial purification (AP) has shown to be the most powerful alternative to adversarial training (AT). However, these methods neglect the fact that pre-trained diffusion models themselves are not robust to adversarial attacks as well. Additionally, the diffusion process can easily destroy semantic information and generate a high quality image but totally different from the original input image after the reverse process, leading to degraded standard accuracy. To overcome these issues, a natural idea is to harness adversarial training strategy to retrain or fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model, which is computationally prohibitive. We propose a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance, which is independent of given pre-trained DMs and avoids retraining or fine-tuning the DMs. This robust guidance can not only ensure to generate purified examples retaining more semantic content but also mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off of DMs for the first time, which also provides DM-based AP an efficient adaptive ability to new attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results and exhibits generalization against different attacks.</p></details> |  |

While model inversion attacks have been widely studied in the context of 2D data, their application to 3D point clouds remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we present the first in-depth study of model inversion attacks aimed at restoring 3D point cloud scenes. Our analysis reveals the unique challenges, the inherent sparsity of 3D point clouds and the ambiguity between empty and non-empty voxels after voxelization, which are further exacerbated by the dispersion of non-empty voxels across feature extractor layers. To address these challenges, we introduce ConcreTizer, a simple yet effective model inversion attack designed specifically for voxel-based 3D point cloud data. ConcreTizer incorporates Voxel Occupancy Classification to distinguish between empty and non-empty voxels and Dispersion-Controlled Supervision to mitigate non-empty voxel dispersion. Extensive experiments on widely used 3D feature extractors and benchmark datasets, such as KITTI and Waymo, demonstrate that ConcreTizer concretely restores the original 3D point cloud scene from disrupted 3D feature data. Our findings highlight both the vulnerability of 3D data to inversion attacks and the urgent need for robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[InferDPT: Privacy-Preserving Inference for Black-box Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12214v7)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have greatly simplified text generation tasks. However, they have also raised concerns about privacy risks such as data leakage and unauthorized data collection. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving inference face practical challenges related to computation time and communication costs. In this paper, we propose InferDPT, the first practical framework for the privacy-preserving Inference of black-box LLMs, implementing Differential Privacy in Text generation. InferDPT comprises two key modules: the "perturbation module" utilizes the exponential mechanism to generate a perturbed prompt, facilitating privacy-preserving inference with black-box LLMs, and the "extraction module", inspired by knowledge distillation and retrieval-augmented generation, extracts coherent and consistent text from the perturbed generation result, ensuring successful text generation completion. To address privacy concerns related to previous exponential mechanisms' susceptibility to embedding revision attacks, we introduce RANTEXT, a novel differential privacy mechanism integrated into the perturbation module of InferDPT, which introduces the concept of "RANdom adjacency" for TEXT perturbation within the prompt. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate that the text generation quality of InferDPT is comparable to that of non-private GPT-4, and RANTEXT surpasses existing state-of-the-art mechanisms, namely, SANTEXT+ and CUSTEXT+ in the trade-off between privacy and utility. Even with an privacy parameter epsilon value of 6.0, RANTEXT achieves an average privacy protection rate exceeding 90% against embedding revision attacks, which is 0.58 times higher than that of SANTEXT+ and 3.35 times higher than that of CUSTEXT+.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIGA: Mutual Information-Guided Attack on Denoising Models for Semantic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06966v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based denoising models have been widely employed in vision tasks, functioning as filters to eliminate noise while retaining crucial semantic information. Additionally, they play a vital role in defending against adversarial perturbations that threaten downstream tasks. However, these models can be intrinsically susceptible to adversarial attacks due to their dependence on specific noise assumptions. Existing attacks on denoising models mainly aim at deteriorating visual clarity while neglecting semantic manipulation, rendering them either easily detectable or limited in effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information-Guided Attack (MIGA), the first method designed to directly attack deep denoising models by strategically disrupting their ability to preserve semantic content via adversarial perturbations. By minimizing the mutual information between the original and denoised images, a measure of semantic similarity. MIGA forces the denoiser to produce perceptually clean yet semantically altered outputs. While these images appear visually plausible, they encode systematically distorted semantics, revealing a fundamental vulnerability in denoising models. These distortions persist in denoised outputs and can be quantitatively assessed through downstream task performance. We propose new evaluation metrics and systematically assess MIGA on four denoising models across five datasets, demonstrating its consistent effectiveness in disrupting semantic fidelity. Our findings suggest that denoising models are not always robust and can introduce security risks in real-world applications. Code is available in the Supplementary Material.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns regarding copyright infringement arise as LLMs may inadvertently produce copyrighted material. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking LLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that incorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the deployment of LLMs. However, we also find that watermarking can have unintended consequences on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern whether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect copyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects the success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text in the pretraining dataset. These results reveal the complex interplay between different regulatory measures, which may impact each other in unforeseen ways. Finally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a recent MIA under watermarking. Our findings underscore the importance of developing adaptive methods to study critical problems in LLMs with potential legal implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures.

However, this integration introduces a new security threat: adversaries can exploit the retrieval mechanism to inject malicious content into the knowledge base, thereby influencing the generated responses. Based on this attack vector, we propose CtrlRAG, a novel attack method designed for RAG system in the black-box setting, which aligns with real-world scenarios. Unlike existing attack methods, CtrlRAG introduces a perturbation mechanism using Masked Language Model (MLM) to dynamically optimize malicious content in response to changes in the retrieved context. Experimental results demonstrate that CtrlRAG outperforms three baseline methods in both Emotional Manipulation and Hallucination Amplification objectives. Furthermore, we evaluate three existing defense mechanisms, revealing their limited effectiveness against CtrlRAG and underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, in tandem with the rapid evolution of MI attacks, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with standardized metrics and reproducible implementations has emerged as a formidable challenge. This deficiency has hindered objective comparison of methodological advancements and reliable assessment of defense efficacy. To address this critical gap, we build the first practical benchmark named MIBench for systematic evaluation of model inversion attacks and defenses. This benchmark bases on an extensible and reproducible modular-based toolbox which currently integrates a total of 19 state-of-the-art attack and defense methods and encompasses 9 standardized evaluation protocols. Capitalizing on this foundation, we conduct extensive evaluation from multiple perspectives to holistically compare and analyze various methods across different scenarios, such as the impact of target resolution, model predictive power, defense performance and adversarial robustness.</p></details> | 20 pages |

We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</p></details> |  |
