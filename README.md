| **[Are Your LLM-based Text-to-SQL Models Secure? Exploring SQL Injection via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[AttestLLM: Efficient Attestation Framework for Billion-scale On-device LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06326v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness, verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical. Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen, and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Prompt Injection Attacks: Risks and Defenses for Modern LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05883v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage. These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection, image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain necessary to achieve reliable protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in Web Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05831v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploit Tool Invocation Prompt for Tool Behavior Hijacking in LLM-Based Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Service Threat Intelligence in LLM Services using Privacy-Preserving Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05608v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries. We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94, significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline, while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Breadcrumbs: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs Through Hidden State and Attention Pattern Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05449v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only marginally better than random guessing against large language models, suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations, rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks. Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected, highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking to Build: A Threat Model of Prompt-Based Attacks for Securing LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04615v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation, fine-tuning, and editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[KubeGuard: LLM-Assisted Kubernetes Hardening via Configuration Files and Runtime Logs Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04191v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p></details> |  |

Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. To counter this, we propose Intent-Aware CoT and Reverse Thinking CoT, which decompose queries to detect malicious intent and reason in reverse to evaluate and reject harmful responses. These methods enhance reasoning robustness and strengthen the model's defense against adversarial exploits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

It reflects a scenario where a defender agent protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy. Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the learned defender strategy and the required training time.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is has been accepted for the 21st International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM-2025).

However, current trust-based mechanisms for IoT have limitations that impact data security. Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure reliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window lengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the effect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score based on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service provider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to filter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In this paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations. The proposed approach determines the window length dynamically to guarantee accurate trust computation. It uses the harmonic mean of average trust score and time to prevent sudden fluctuations in trust scores. Additionally, an efficient personalized subspace clustering algorithm is used to exclude recommendations. We present a security analysis demonstrating the resiliency of the proposed scheme against bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and on-off attacks. The proposed scheme demonstrates a competitive performance in detecting bad-mouthing attacks, while outperforming existing works with an approximately 44% improvement in accuracy for detecting on-off attacks. It maintains its effectiveness even when the percentage of on-off attackers increases and in scenarios where multiple attacks occur simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed scheme reduces the recommendation filtering time by 95%.</p></details> | References added |
| **[Soft Token Attacks Cannot Reliably Audit Unlearning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15836v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are trained using massive datasets, which often contain undesirable content such as harmful texts, personal information, and copyrighted material. To address this, machine unlearning aims to remove information from trained models. Recent work has shown that soft token attacks (STA) can successfully extract unlearned information from LLMs, but in this work we show that STAs can be an inadequate tool for auditing unlearning. Using common benchmarks such as Who Is Harry Potter? and TOFU, we demonstrate that in a strong auditor setting such attacks can elicit any information from the LLM, regardless of the deployed unlearning algorithm or whether the queried content was originally present in the training corpus. We further show that STA with just a few soft tokens (1-10) can elicit random strings over 400 characters long, indicating that STAs must be used carefully to effectively audit unlearning.

Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |

While these models have shown promising performance, concerns have been raised regarding the potential misuse of the generated fake images. In response to this, we have presented a simple yet effective training-free method to attribute fake images generated by text-to-image models to their source models. Given a test image to be attributed, we first inverse the textual prompt of the image, and then put the reconstructed prompt into different candidate models to regenerate candidate fake images. By calculating and ranking the similarity of the test image and the candidate images, we can determine the source of the image. This attribution allows model owners to be held accountable for any misuse of their models. Note that our approach does not limit the number of candidate text-to-image generative models. Comprehensive experiments reveal that (1) Our method can effectively attribute fake images to their source models, achieving comparable attribution performance with the state-of-the-art method; (2) Our method has high scalability ability, which is well adapted to real-world attribution scenarios. (3) The proposed method yields satisfactory robustness to common attacks, such as Gaussian blurring, JPEG compression, and Resizing. We also analyze the factors that influence the attribution performance, and explore the boost brought by the proposed method as a plug-in to improve the performance of existing SOTA. We hope our work can shed some light on the solutions to addressing the source of AI-generated images, as well as to prevent the misuse of text-to-image generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been withdrawn by the authors because the proposed approach is currently undergoing optimization and improvement.

Consequently, ensuring the security and resilience of IoT systems has become a critical requirement. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) for IoT environments, leveraging a hybrid model of CNN and ConvNeXt-Tiny. The proposed method is designed to detect and classify different types of network attacks, particularly botnet and malicious traffic, while the lightweight ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture enables effective deployment in resource-constrained devices and networks. A real-world dataset comprising both benign and malicious network packets collected from practical IoT scenarios was employed in the experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing training and inference time compared to more complex models. Specifically, the system attained 99.63% accuracy in the testing phase, 99.67% accuracy in the training phase, and an error rate of 0.0107 across eight classes, while maintaining short response times and low resource consumption. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and classifying attacks in real-world IoT environments, indicating that the lightweight architecture can serve as a practical alternative to complex and resource-intensive approaches in IoT network security.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

We propose REVS, a novel non-gradient-based method for unlearning sensitive information from LMs. REVS identifies and modifies a small subset of neurons relevant for constituent tokens that form sensitive information. To adequately evaluate our method on truly sensitive information, we curate three datasets: email and URL datasets naturally memorized by the models, and a synthetic social security number dataset that we tune the models to memorize. Compared to other methods, REVS demonstrates superior performance in unlearning sensitive information and robustness to extraction attacks, while retaining underlying model integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Findings, 24 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |

Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. To counter this, we propose Intent-Aware CoT and Reverse Thinking CoT, which decompose queries to detect malicious intent and reason in reverse to evaluate and reject harmful responses. These methods enhance reasoning robustness and strengthen the model's defense against adversarial exploits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

It reflects a scenario where a defender agent protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy. Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the learned defender strategy and the required training time.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is has been accepted for the 21st International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM-2025).

| **[An Efficient Recommendation Filtering-based Trust Model for Securing Internet of Things](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17304v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trust computation is crucial for ensuring the security of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current trust-based mechanisms for IoT have limitations that impact data security. Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure reliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window lengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the effect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score based on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service provider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to filter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In this paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations. The proposed approach determines the window length dynamically to guarantee accurate trust computation. It uses the harmonic mean of average trust score and time to prevent sudden fluctuations in trust scores. Additionally, an efficient personalized subspace clustering algorithm is used to exclude recommendations. We present a security analysis demonstrating the resiliency of the proposed scheme against bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and on-off attacks. The proposed scheme demonstrates a competitive performance in detecting bad-mouthing attacks, while outperforming existing works with an approximately 44% improvement in accuracy for detecting on-off attacks. It maintains its effectiveness even when the percentage of on-off attackers increases and in scenarios where multiple attacks occur simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed scheme reduces the recommendation filtering time by 95%.</p></details> | References added |

To address this, machine unlearning aims to remove information from trained models. Recent work has shown that soft token attacks (STA) can successfully extract unlearned information from LLMs, but in this work we show that STAs can be an inadequate tool for auditing unlearning. Using common benchmarks such as Who Is Harry Potter? and TOFU, we demonstrate that in a strong auditor setting such attacks can elicit any information from the LLM, regardless of the deployed unlearning algorithm or whether the queried content was originally present in the training corpus. We further show that STA with just a few soft tokens (1-10) can elicit random strings over 400 characters long, indicating that STAs must be used carefully to effectively audit unlearning.
