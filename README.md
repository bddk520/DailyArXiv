| **[Guided Reasoning in LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Using Structured Attack Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07939v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems. Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and 78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Attacks of Social Engineering in Multi-turn Conversations: LLM Agents for Simulation and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15552v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of conversational agents, particularly chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), poses a significant risk of social engineering (SE) attacks on social media platforms. SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the SE attack mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a paper at COLM 2025 Workshop on AI Agents: Capabilities and Safety</p></details> |
| **[Attacking LLMs and AI Agents: Advertisement Embedding Attacks Against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17674v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1) hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Are Your LLM-based Text-to-SQL Models Secure? Exploring SQL Injection via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[AttestLLM: Efficient Attestation Framework for Billion-scale On-device LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06326v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness, verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical. Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen, and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Prompt Injection Attacks: Risks and Defenses for Modern LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05883v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage. These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection, image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain necessary to achieve reliable protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in Web Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05831v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploit Tool Invocation Prompt for Tool Behavior Hijacking in LLM-Based Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Service Threat Intelligence in LLM Services using Privacy-Preserving Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05608v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries. We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94, significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline, while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.</p></details> |  |

The analysis shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect detectors, it can be sub-optimal in the long run to employ defensive responses while under attack; that is, depending on attack dynamics and response effectiveness, the total overhead of ongoing defensive countermeasures can exceed the total risk of intermittent security failures. The analysis similarly examines the availability loss versus the risk reduction of employing preemptive resets, isolating key factors that determine whether system recovery is best initiated reactively or proactively. We also discuss model extensions and related work looking towards intrusion tolerance applications with (i) imperfect or controllable detectors, (ii) multiple types of attacks, (iii) continuous-time dynamics or (iv) strategic attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, unpublished/rejected manuscript circa 2010</p></details> |

While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

To address this, we propose \textbf{OBLIVIATE}, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA) ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: \emph{forget quality} (via a new document-level memorization score), \emph{model utility}, and \emph{fluency}. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EMNLP 25 main conference</p></details> |
| **[A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Deep Learning Model for Intrusion Detection in Smart Grid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07208v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology. However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions, and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.

AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1) hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. To counter this, we propose Intent-Aware CoT and Reverse Thinking CoT, which decompose queries to detect malicious intent and reason in reverse to evaluate and reject harmful responses. These methods enhance reasoning robustness and strengthen the model's defense against adversarial exploits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

It reflects a scenario where a defender agent protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy. Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the learned defender strategy and the required training time.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is has been accepted for the 21st International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM-2025).

| **[An Efficient Recommendation Filtering-based Trust Model for Securing Internet of Things](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17304v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trust computation is crucial for ensuring the security of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current trust-based mechanisms for IoT have limitations that impact data security. Sliding window-based trust schemes cannot ensure reliable trust computation due to their inability to select appropriate window lengths. Besides, recent trust scores are emphasized when considering the effect of time on trust. This can cause a sudden change in overall trust score based on recent behavior, potentially misinterpreting an honest service provider as malicious and vice versa. Moreover, clustering mechanisms used to filter recommendations in trust computation often lead to slower results. In this paper, we propose a robust trust model to address these limitations. The proposed approach determines the window length dynamically to guarantee accurate trust computation. It uses the harmonic mean of average trust score and time to prevent sudden fluctuations in trust scores. Additionally, an efficient personalized subspace clustering algorithm is used to exclude recommendations. We present a security analysis demonstrating the resiliency of the proposed scheme against bad-mouthing, ballot-stuffing, and on-off attacks. The proposed scheme demonstrates a competitive performance in detecting bad-mouthing attacks, while outperforming existing works with an approximately 44% improvement in accuracy for detecting on-off attacks. It maintains its effectiveness even when the percentage of on-off attackers increases and in scenarios where multiple attacks occur simultaneously. Additionally, the proposed scheme reduces the recommendation filtering time by 95%.</p></details> | References added |
| **[Soft Token Attacks Cannot Reliably Audit Unlearning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15836v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are trained using massive datasets, which often contain undesirable content such as harmful texts, personal information, and copyrighted material. To address this, machine unlearning aims to remove information from trained models. Recent work has shown that soft token attacks (STA) can successfully extract unlearned information from LLMs, but in this work we show that STAs can be an inadequate tool for auditing unlearning. Using common benchmarks such as Who Is Harry Potter? and TOFU, we demonstrate that in a strong auditor setting such attacks can elicit any information from the LLM, regardless of the deployed unlearning algorithm or whether the queried content was originally present in the training corpus. We further show that STA with just a few soft tokens (1-10) can elicit random strings over 400 characters long, indicating that STAs must be used carefully to effectively audit unlearning.

Exploring SQL Injection via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |

| **[A Markov Decision Process Model for Intrusion Tolerance Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07919v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate and analyze a simplest Markov decision process model for intrusion tolerance problems, assuming that (i) each attack proceeds through one or more steps before the system's security fails, (ii) defensive responses that target these intermediate steps may only sometimes thwart the attack and (iii) reset responses that are sensible upon discovering an attack's completion may not always recover from the security failure. The analysis shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect detectors, it can be sub-optimal in the long run to employ defensive responses while under attack; that is, depending on attack dynamics and response effectiveness, the total overhead of ongoing defensive countermeasures can exceed the total risk of intermittent security failures. The analysis similarly examines the availability loss versus the risk reduction of employing preemptive resets, isolating key factors that determine whether system recovery is best initiated reactively or proactively. We also discuss model extensions and related work looking towards intrusion tolerance applications with (i) imperfect or controllable detectors, (ii) multiple types of attacks, (iii) continuous-time dynamics or (iv) strategic attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, unpublished/rejected manuscript circa 2010</p></details> |
| **[Robust Adaptation of Large Multimodal Models for Retrieval Augmented Hateful Meme Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13061v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hateful memes have become a significant concern on the Internet, necessitating robust automated detection systems. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

To address this, we propose \textbf{OBLIVIATE}, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA) ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: \emph{forget quality} (via a new document-level memorization score), \emph{model utility}, and \emph{fluency}. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at EMNLP 25 main conference</p></details> |
| **[A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Deep Learning Model for Intrusion Detection in Smart Grid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07208v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology. However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions, and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills. DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection accuracy of 99.70%.</p></details> |  |
