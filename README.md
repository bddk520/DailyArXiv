| **[Confusion is the Final Barrier: Rethinking Jailbreak Evaluation and Investigating the Real Misuse Threat of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16347v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.</p></details> |  |

We analyze which information-theoretic mechanisms resist adversarial manipulation, extending finite-sample bounds to show that bounded f-divergences (e.g., total variation distance) maintain polynomial guarantees under attacks while unbounded measures (e.g., KL divergence) degrade exponentially. To implement these mechanisms, we model the overseer as an agent and characterize incentive-compatible scoring rules as f-mutual information objectives. Under adversarial attacks, TVD-MI maintains effectiveness (area under curve 0.70-0.77) while traditional judge queries are near change (AUC $\approx$ 0.50), demonstrating that querying the same LLM for information relationships rather than quality judgments provides both theoretical and practical robustness. The mechanisms decompose pairwise evaluations into reliable item-level quality scores without ground truth, addressing a key limitation of traditional peer prediction. We release preregistration and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add A...</summary><p>Add AUC results, pre-reg conformance, theory section clarification. 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Injection Attack to Tool Selection in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19793v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. A popular approach follows a two-step process - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, DataSentinel, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection). Our experimental results indicate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Unlearning Harmful Information in LLMs with Metamorphosis Representation Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15449v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in https://github.com/ChengcanWu/MRP.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, Under review as a full paper at AAAI 2026.

| **[IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[MoEcho: Exploiting Side-Channel Attacks to Compromise User Privacy in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15036v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Disguise Attack: Induce the LLM to disguise itself for AIGT detection evasion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15848v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models (LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.</p></details> |  |

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce \textit{two new} jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 95\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Safety Neurons with Training-Free Continual Projection to Reduce LLM Fine Tuning Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCFC: Core & Core-Full-Core Dual-Track Defense for LLM Jailbreak Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14128v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs' vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks. CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer LLM deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

Existing adversarial prompt generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling multilingual assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure; article under review</p></details> |

To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-Guard, a robust, layered defense architecture designed for LLM--tool interactions. MCP-Guard employs a three-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it progresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural detector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model achieves (96.01) accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts. Finally, a lightweight LLM arbitrator synthesizes these signals to deliver the final decision while minimizing false positives. To facilitate rigorous training and evaluation, we also introduce MCP-AttackBench, a comprehensive benchmark of over 70,000 samples. Sourced from public datasets and augmented by GPT-4, MCP-AttackBench simulates diverse, real-world attack vectors in the MCP format, providing a foundation for future research into securing LLM-tool ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying, malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign queries.

However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.12145</p></details> |
| **[An Investigation of Visual Foundation Models Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16225v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision, powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[PickleBall: Secure Deserialization of Pickle-based Machine Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15987v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning model repositories such as the Hugging Face Model Hub facilitate model exchanges. However, bad actors can deliver malware through compromised models. Existing defenses such as safer model formats, restrictive (but inflexible) loading policies, and model scanners have shortcomings: 44.9% of popular models on Hugging Face still use the insecure pickle format, 15% of these cannot be loaded by restrictive loading policies, and model scanners have both false positives and false negatives. Pickle remains the de facto standard for model exchange, and the ML community lacks a tool that offers transparent safe loading. We present PickleBall to help machine learning engineers load pickle-based models safely. PickleBall statically analyzes the source code of a given machine learning library and computes a custom policy that specifies a safe load-time behavior for benign models. PickleBall then dynamically enforces the policy during load time as a drop-in replacement for the pickle module. PickleBall generates policies that correctly load 79.8% of benign pickle-based models in our dataset, while rejecting all (100%) malicious examples in our dataset. In comparison, evaluated model scanners fail to identify known malicious models, and the state-of-art loader loads 22% fewer benign models than PickleBall. PickleBall removes the threat of arbitrary function invocation from malicious pickle-based models, raising the bar for attackers to depend on code reuse techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of 2025 ACM CCS</p></details> |
| **[SDGO: Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization for Consistent Safety in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15648v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025, 15 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This significant limitation raises critical provenance questions, particularly in scenarios involving copyright and accountability concerns. To bridge this fundamental gap, we introduce DualMark, the first dual-provenance watermarking framework capable of simultaneously encoding two distinct attribution signatures, i.e., model identity and dataset origin, into audio generative models during training. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual Watermark Embedding (DWE) module to seamlessly embed dual watermarks into Mel-spectrogram representations, accompanied by a carefully designed Watermark Consistency Loss (WCL), which ensures reliable extraction of both watermarks from generated audio signals. Moreover, we establish the Dual Attribution Benchmark (DAB), the first robustness evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for joint model-data attribution. Extensive experiments validate that DualMark achieves outstanding attribution accuracy (97.01% F1-score for model attribution, and 91.51% AUC for dataset attribution), while maintaining exceptional robustness against aggressive pruning, lossy compression, additive noise, and sampling attacks, conditions that severely compromise prior methods. Our work thus provides a foundational step toward fully accountable audio generative models, significantly enhancing copyright protection and responsibility tracing capabilities.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Foundation Models for Multimodal Entity Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15481v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking (LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset, and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of multimodal systems in adversarial environments.</p></details> |  |

Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights and outlining future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Existing adversarial prompt generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling multilingual assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure; article under review</p></details> |

To counter these challenges, we propose MCP-Guard, a robust, layered defense architecture designed for LLM--tool interactions. MCP-Guard employs a three-stage detection pipeline that balances efficiency with accuracy: it progresses from lightweight static scanning for overt threats and a deep neural detector for semantic attacks, to our fine-tuned E5-based model achieves (96.01) accuracy in identifying adversarial prompts. Finally, a lightweight LLM arbitrator synthesizes these signals to deliver the final decision while minimizing false positives. To facilitate rigorous training and evaluation, we also introduce MCP-AttackBench, a comprehensive benchmark of over 70,000 samples. Sourced from public datasets and augmented by GPT-4, MCP-AttackBench simulates diverse, real-world attack vectors in the MCP format, providing a foundation for future research into securing LLM-tool ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying, malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a controllable manner.</p></details> |  |
