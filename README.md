| **[Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07163v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Simple.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenBFA: An Evolutionary Optimization Approach to Bit-Flip Attacks on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13757v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Allies to Adversaries: Manipulating LLM Tool-Calling through Adversarial Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10198v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-calling has changed Large Language Model (LLM) applications by integrating external tools, significantly enhancing their functionality across diverse tasks. However, this integration also introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly in the tool scheduling mechanisms of LLM, which have not been extensively studied. To fill this gap, we present ToolCommander, a novel framework designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLM tool-calling systems through adversarial tool injection. Our framework employs a well-designed two-stage attack strategy. Firstly, it injects malicious tools to collect user queries, then dynamically updates the injected tools based on the stolen information to enhance subsequent attacks. These stages enable ToolCommander to execute privacy theft, launch denial-of-service attacks, and even manipulate business competition by triggering unscheduled tool-calling. Notably, the ASR reaches 91.67% for privacy theft and hits 100% for denial-of-service and unscheduled tool calling in certain cases. Our work demonstrates that these vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences beyond simple misuse of tool-calling systems, underscoring the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to secure LLM Tool-calling systems.</p></details> |  |

While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using LLM-driven autonomous systems for Assumed Breach penetration testing in enterprise networks. We introduce a novel prototype that, driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), can compromise accounts within a real-life Active Directory testbed. Our research provides a comprehensive evaluation of the prototype's capabilities, and highlights both strengths and limitations while executing attack. The evaluation uses a realistic simulation environment (Game of Active Directory, GOAD) to capture intricate interactions, stochastic outcomes, and timing dependencies that characterize live network scenarios. The study concludes that autonomous LLMs are able to conduct Assumed Breach simulations, potentially democratizing access to penetration testing for organizations facing budgetary constraints. The prototype's source code, traces, and analyzed logs are released as open-source to enhance collective cybersecurity and facilitate future research in LLM-driven cybersecurity automation.</p></details> |  |
| **["Short-length" Adversarial Training Helps LLMs Defend "Long-length" Jailbreak Attacks: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04204v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.</p></details> |  |
| **[OverThink: Slowdown Attacks on Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02542v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We increase overhead for applications that rely on reasoning LLMs-we force models to spend an amplified number of reasoning tokens, i.e., "overthink", to respond to the user query while providing contextually correct answers. The adversary performs an OVERTHINK attack by injecting decoy reasoning problems into the public content that is used by the reasoning LLM (e.g., for RAG applications) during inference time. Due to the nature of our decoy problems (e.g., a Markov Decision Process), modified texts do not violate safety guardrails. We evaluated our attack across closed-(OpenAI o1, o1-mini, o3-mini) and open-(DeepSeek R1) weights reasoning models on the FreshQA and SQuAD datasets. Our results show up to 18x slowdown on FreshQA dataset and 46x slowdown on SQuAD dataset. The attack also shows high transferability across models. To protect applications, we discuss and implement defenses leveraging LLM-based and system design approaches. Finally, we discuss societal, financial, and energy impacts of OVERTHINK attack which could amplify the costs for third-party applications operating reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SelfDefend: LLMs Can Defend Themselves against Jailbreaking in a Practical Manner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05498v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking is an emerging adversarial attack that bypasses the safety alignment deployed in off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) and has evolved into multiple categories: human-based, optimization-based, generation-based, and the recent indirect and multilingual jailbreaks. However, delivering a practical jailbreak defense is challenging because it needs to not only handle all the above jailbreak attacks but also incur negligible delays to user prompts, as well as be compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Inspired by how the traditional security concept of shadow stacks defends against memory overflow attacks, this paper introduces a generic LLM jailbreak defense framework called SelfDefend, which establishes a shadow LLM as a defense instance (in detection state) to concurrently protect the target LLM instance (in normal answering state) in the normal stack and collaborate with it for checkpoint-based access control. The effectiveness of SelfDefend builds upon our observation that existing LLMs can identify harmful prompts or intentions in user queries, which we empirically validate using mainstream GPT-3.5/4 models against major jailbreak attacks. To further improve the defense's robustness and minimize costs, we employ a data distillation approach to tune dedicated open-source defense models. When deployed to protect GPT-3.5/4, Claude, Llama-2-7b/13b, and Mistral, these models outperform seven state-of-the-art defenses and match the performance of GPT-4-based SelfDefend, with significantly lower extra delays. Further experiments show that the tuned models are robust to adaptive jailbreaks and prompt injections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security Symposium 2025.

| **[Certifying LLM Safety against Adversarial Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02705v4)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that add malicious tokens to an input prompt to bypass the safety guardrails of an LLM and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, the first framework for defending against adversarial prompts with certifiable safety guarantees. Given a prompt, our procedure erases tokens individually and inspects the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. Our safety certificate guarantees that harmful prompts are not mislabeled as safe due to an adversarial attack up to a certain size. We implement the safety filter in two ways, using Llama 2 and DistilBERT, and compare the performance of erase-and-check for the two cases. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, where an adversarial sequence is appended at the end of a harmful prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Our experimental results demonstrate that this procedure can obtain strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts. Additionally, we propose three efficient empirical defenses: i) RandEC, a randomized subsampling version of erase-and-check; ii) GreedyEC, which greedily erases tokens that maximize the softmax score of the harmful class; and iii) GradEC, which uses gradient information to optimize tokens to erase. We demonstrate their effectiveness against adversarial prompts generated by the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack algorithm. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/aounon/certified-llm-safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLM 2024: https://openreview.net/forum?id=9Ik05cycLq</p></details> |

| **[Do Unlearning Methods Remove Information from Language Model Weights?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08827v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models' knowledge of how to perform cyber-security attacks, create bioweapons, and manipulate humans poses risks of misuse. Previous work has proposed methods to unlearn this knowledge. Historically, it has been unclear whether unlearning techniques are removing information from the model weights or just making it harder to access. To disentangle these two objectives, we propose an adversarial evaluation method to test for the removal of information from model weights: we give an attacker access to some facts that were supposed to be removed, and using those, the attacker tries to recover other facts from the same distribution that cannot be guessed from the accessible facts. We show that using fine-tuning on the accessible facts can recover 88% of the pre-unlearning accuracy when applied to current unlearning methods for information learned during pretraining, revealing the limitations of these methods in removing information from the model weights. Our results also suggest that unlearning evaluations that measure unlearning robustness on information learned during an additional fine-tuning phase may overestimate robustness compared to evaluations that attempt to unlearn information learned during pretraining.</p></details> |  |

Although advancements have been made in detection techniques, traditional signature-based methods still struggle to identify sophisticated SQL injection attacks that evade predefined patterns. As SQLi attacks evolve, the need for more adaptive detection systems becomes crucial. This paper introduces an innovative approach that leverages generative models to enhance SQLi detection and prevention mechanisms. By incorporating Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Conditional Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP), and U-Net, synthetic SQL queries were generated to augment training datasets for machine learning models. The proposed method demonstrated improved accuracy in SQLi detection systems by reducing both false positives and false negatives. Extensive empirical testing further illustrated the ability of the system to adapt to evolving SQLi attack patterns, resulting in enhanced precision and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 22 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[DMPA: Model Poisoning Attacks on Decentralized Federated Learning for Model Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04771v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant attention as a prominent privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML) paradigm. Decentralized FL (DFL) eschews traditional FL's centralized server architecture, enhancing the system's robustness and scalability. However, these advantages of DFL also create new vulnerabilities for malicious participants to execute adversarial attacks, especially model poisoning attacks. In model poisoning attacks, malicious participants aim to diminish the performance of benign models by creating and disseminating the compromised model. Existing research on model poisoning attacks has predominantly concentrated on undermining global models within the Centralized FL (CFL) paradigm, while there needs to be more research in DFL. To fill the research gap, this paper proposes an innovative model poisoning attack called DMPA. This attack calculates the differential characteristics of multiple malicious client models and obtains the most effective poisoning strategy, thereby orchestrating a collusive attack by multiple participants. The effectiveness of this attack is validated across multiple datasets, with results indicating that the DMPA approach consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art FL model poisoning attack strategies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing emails, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.

Jailbreak attacks, which manipulate LLMs into generating harmful content, pose significant challenges to this balance. Existing defenses, such as prompt engineering and safety fine-tuning, often introduce computational overhead, increase inference latency, and lack runtime flexibility. Moreover, overly restrictive safety measures can degrade model utility by causing refusals of benign queries. In this paper, we introduce Jailbreak Antidote, a method that enables real-time adjustment of LLM safety preferences by manipulating a sparse subset of the model's internal states during inference. By shifting the model's hidden representations along a safety direction with varying strengths, we achieve flexible control over the safety-utility balance without additional token overhead or inference delays. Our analysis reveals that safety-related information in LLMs is sparsely distributed; adjusting approximately 5% of the internal state is as effective as modifying the entire state. Extensive experiments on nine LLMs (ranging from 2 billion to 72 billion parameters), evaluated against ten jailbreak attack methods and compared with six defense strategies, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. By directly manipulating internal states during reasoning, Jailbreak Antidote offers a lightweight, scalable solution that enhances LLM safety while preserving utility, opening new possibilities for real-time safety mechanisms in widely-deployed AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025. url: https://openreview.net/forum?id=s20W12XTF8</p></details> |

However, while most VLM research focuses on enhancing multi-modal interaction, the risks of data misuse and leakage have been largely unexplored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of such risks in VLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of misuse and leakage detection in VLMs through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA). In specific, we focus on the instruction tuning data of VLMs, which is more likely to contain sensitive or unauthorized information. To address the limitation of existing MIA methods, we introduce a novel approach that infers membership based on a set of samples and their sensitivity to temperature, a unique parameter in VLMs. Based on this, we propose four membership inference methods, each tailored to different levels of background knowledge, ultimately arriving at the most challenging scenario. Our comprehensive evaluations show that these methods can accurately determine membership status, e.g., achieving an AUC greater than 0.8 targeting a small set consisting of only 5 samples on LLaVA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX'25; 22 pages, 28 figures;</p></details> |

As these systems have scaled, such issues have persisted. Currently, large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters suffer from adversarial attacks just like their earlier, smaller counterparts. However, the threat models have changed. Previously, having gray-box access, where input embeddings or output logits/probabilities were visible to the user, might have been reasonable. However, with the introduction of closed-source models, no information about the model is available apart from the generated output. This means that current black-box attacks can only utilize the final prediction to detect if an attack is successful. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the potential of attack guidance, akin to using output probabilities, while having only black-box access in a classification setting. This is achieved through the ability to elicit confidence from the model. We empirically show that the elicited confidence is calibrated and not hallucinated for current LLMs. By minimizing the elicited confidence, we can therefore increase the likelihood of misclassification. Our new proposed paradigm demonstrates promising state-of-the-art results on three datasets across two models (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3) when comparing our technique to existing hard-label black-box attack methods that introduce word-level substitutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2025.

Based on the insights from the self-attention computation process, this paper proposes a novel blackbox jailbreak approach, which involves crafting the payload prompt by strategically injecting the prohibited query into a carrier article. The carrier article maintains the semantic proximity to the prohibited query, which is automatically produced by combining a hypernymy article and a context, both of which are generated from the prohibited query. The intuition behind the usage of carrier article is to activate the neurons in the model related to the semantics of the prohibited query while suppressing the neurons that will trigger the objectionable text. Carrier article itself is benign, and we leveraged prompt injection techniques to produce the payload prompt. We evaluate our approach using JailbreakBench, testing against four target models across 100 distinct jailbreak objectives. The experimental results demonstrate our method's superior effectiveness, achieving an average success rate of 63% across all target models, significantly outperforming existing blackbox jailbreak methods.</p></details> |  |

However, malicious servers could deliberately manipulate the models to reconstruct clients' data from shared gradients, posing significant privacy risks. Although such active gradient leakage attacks (AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from several limitations including incomplete attack coverage and poor stealthiness. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses SOTA with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR).</p></details> |  |

To address this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are proposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable content. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text encoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of \textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To overcome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks within a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order Optimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and D-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated our method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and online servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show that DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous works, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has proposed methods to unlearn this knowledge. Historically, it has been unclear whether unlearning techniques are removing information from the model weights or just making it harder to access. To disentangle these two objectives, we propose an adversarial evaluation method to test for the removal of information from model weights: we give an attacker access to some facts that were supposed to be removed, and using those, the attacker tries to recover other facts from the same distribution that cannot be guessed from the accessible facts. We show that using fine-tuning on the accessible facts can recover 88% of the pre-unlearning accuracy when applied to current unlearning methods for information learned during pretraining, revealing the limitations of these methods in removing information from the model weights. Our results also suggest that unlearning evaluations that measure unlearning robustness on information learned during an additional fine-tuning phase may overestimate robustness compared to evaluations that attempt to unlearn information learned during pretraining.</p></details> |  |
