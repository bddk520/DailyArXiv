Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce \textit{two new} jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 95\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Safety Neurons with Training-Free Continual Projection to Reduce LLM Fine Tuning Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</p></details> |  |

We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 3 tables; code and certification harness: https://github.com/ayushgupta4897/Contextual-Integrity-Verification ; Elite-Attack dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/zyushg/elite-attack</p></details> |
| **[RepreGuard: Detecting LLM-Generated Text by Revealing Hidden Representation Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13152v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method. Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks.

| **[Quantifying Loss Aversion in Cyber Adversaries via LLM Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13240v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying human cognitive biases from empirical data has long posed a formidable challenge, particularly in cybersecurity, where defending against unknown adversaries is paramount. Traditional cyber defense strategies have largely focused on fortification, while some approaches attempt to anticipate attacker strategies by mapping them to cognitive vulnerabilities, yet they fall short in dynamically interpreting attacks in progress. In recognition of this gap, IARPA's ReSCIND program seeks to infer, defend against, and even exploit attacker cognitive traits. In this paper, we present a novel methodology that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract quantifiable insights into the cognitive bias of loss aversion from hacker behavior. Our data are collected from an experiment in which hackers were recruited to attack a controlled demonstration network. We process the hacker generated notes using LLMs using it to segment the various actions and correlate the actions to predefined persistence mechanisms used by hackers. By correlating the implementation of these mechanisms with various operational triggers, our analysis provides new insights into how loss aversion manifests in hacker decision-making. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively dissect and interpret nuanced behavioral patterns, thereby offering a transformative approach to enhancing cyber defense strategies through real-time, behavior-based analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Too Easily Fooled? Prompt Injection Breaks LLMs on Frustratingly Simple Multiple-Choice Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13214v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong emergent abilities in complex reasoning and zero-shot generalization, showing unprecedented potential for LLM-as-a-judge applications in education, peer review, and data quality evaluation. However, their robustness under prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content to manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore a frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be easily misled. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions (e.g., "What is 3 + 2?") presented as either multiple-choice or true-false judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the file. Our results reveal that LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt injection attacks, even in these trivial scenarios, highlighting serious robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v5)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invitation Is All You Need! Promptware Attacks Against LLM-Powered Assistants in Production Are Practical and Dangerous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12175v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security risks, notably known as Promptware - maliciously engineered prompts designed to manipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior research warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered applications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In this paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered assistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We propose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess Promptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt injection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations, and shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against Gemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term Context Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent Invocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital and physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation campaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of home automation devices. We reveal Promptware's potential for on-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger malicious actions using a device's applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of the analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss mitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and show that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We disclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/invitation-is-all-you-need/home</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Jailbreaks with Intent-Aware LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12072v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive safety-tuning, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks via adversarially crafted instructions, reflecting a persistent trade-off between safety and task performance. In this work, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that explicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before responding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions, Intent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks, thereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate both parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary models, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact against white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all evaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\% success rate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly, our method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive refusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords. Furthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful intent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively transferred to enhance vanilla model defenses.</p></details> |  |

| **[FedUP: Efficient Pruning-based Federated Unlearning for Model Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13853v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining. However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative, applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data.

However, current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage, without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT.</p></details> |  |

Threat Modeling, that is, comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently, there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models. Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$, far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label classification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on specific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better precision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences of a cyberattack.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures,Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computers, Software, & Applications (COMPSAC), EATA Symposium, Toronto, Canada, July 8-11, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Do Large Language Model Agents Exhibit a Survival Instinct? An Empirical Study in a Sugarscape-Style Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12920v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However, aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%. These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heuristic-Induced Multimodal Risk Distribution Jailbreak Attack for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05934v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), concerns regarding their security have increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the highly constrained adversarial capabilities in real-world deployment scenarios. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which is black-box and consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to distribute harmful semantics into multiple modalities to effectively circumvent the single-modality protection mechanisms of MLLMs. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps MLLMs reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. HIMRD achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 90% across seven open-source MLLMs and an average ASR of around 68% in three closed-source MLLMs. HIMRD reveals cross-modal security vulnerabilities in current MLLMs and underscores the imperative for developing defensive strategies to mitigate such emerging risks.

| **[Where to Start Alignment? Diffusion Large Language Model May Demand a Distinct Position](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12398v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and inference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs' safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research primarily focuses on refining ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

While MCP enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP clients, and attack scripts to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across different hosts and models. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Lingnan University, Hong Kong</p></details> |

Nevertheless, because endpoint devices have limited computation, storage, and communication capabilities, the IoT infrastructure is vulnerable to several cyber threats. As a result, DDoS attacks pose a severe risk to the security of IoT. By taking advantage of these weaknesses, attackers may quickly employ IoT devices as a component of botnets to execute DDoS attacks. The most critical development is how more armies of robots are being constructed from IoT devices. We offer a Model for dealing with DDOS attacks on botnets in the Internet of Things via trust management. In this Model, an attempt has been made to consider all aspects of security concerning trust factors to design a reliable and flexible model against DDoS attacks against the Internet of Things.

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining. However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative, applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving storage compared to the SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
