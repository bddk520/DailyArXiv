| **[ACE: A Security Architecture for LLM-Integrated App Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20984v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that our system is secure against attacks from the INJECAGENT benchmark, a standard benchmark for control flow integrity in the face of indirect prompt injection attacks, and our newly introduced attacks. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems containing system facilities of varying levels of trustworthiness.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |

In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

| **[Token-Efficient Prompt Injection Attack: Provoking Cessation in LLM Reasoning via Adaptive Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20493v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks, they also contain notable security vulnerabilities. Recent research has uncovered a "thinking-stopped" vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1, where model-generated reasoning tokens can forcibly interrupt the inference process, resulting in empty responses that compromise LLM-integrated applications. However, existing methods triggering this vulnerability require complex mathematical word problems with long prompts--even exceeding 5,000 tokens. To reduce the token cost and formally define this vulnerability, we propose a novel prompt injection attack named "Reasoning Interruption Attack", based on adaptive token compression. We demonstrate that simple standalone arithmetic tasks can effectively trigger this vulnerability, and the prompts based on such tasks exhibit simpler logical structures than mathematical word problems. We develop a systematic approach to efficiently collect attack prompts and an adaptive token compression framework that utilizes LLMs to automatically compress these prompts. Experiments show our compression framework significantly reduces prompt length while maintaining effective attack capabilities. We further investigate the attack's performance via output prefix and analyze the underlying causes of the vulnerability, providing valuable insights for improving security in reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Leakage Attacks on Searchable Symmetric Encryption Using LLM-Based Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20414v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) enables efficient search capabilities over encrypted data, allowing users to maintain privacy while utilizing cloud storage. However, SSE schemes are vulnerable to leakage attacks that exploit access patterns, search frequency, and volume information. Existing studies frequently assume that adversaries possess a substantial fraction of the encrypted dataset to mount effective inference attacks, implying there is a database leakage of such documents, thus, an assumption that may not hold in real-world scenarios. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of enhancing leakage attacks under a more realistic threat model in which adversaries have access to minimal leaked data. We propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 variants, to generate synthetic documents that statistically and semantically resemble the real-world dataset of Enron emails. Using the email corpus as a case study, we evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data generated via random sampling and hierarchical clustering methods on the performance of the SAP (Search Access Pattern) keyword inference attack restricted to token volumes only. Our results demonstrate that, while the choice of LLM has limited effect, increasing dataset size and employing clustering-based generation significantly improve attack accuracy, achieving comparable performance to attacks using larger amounts of real data. We highlight the growing relevance of LLMs in adversarial contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadMoE: Backdooring Mixture-of-Experts LLMs via Optimizing Routing Triggers and Infecting Dormant Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18598v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have emerged as a powerful architecture for large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient scaling of model capacity while maintaining manageable computational costs. The key advantage lies in their ability to route different tokens to different ``expert'' networks within the model, enabling specialization and efficient handling of diverse input. However, the vulnerabilities of MoE-based LLMs still have barely been studied, and the potential for backdoor attacks in this context remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first backdoor attack against MoE-based LLMs where the attackers poison ``dormant experts'' (i.e., underutilized experts) and activate them by optimizing routing triggers, thereby gaining control over the model's output. We first rigorously prove the existence of a few ``dominating experts'' in MoE models, whose outputs can determine the overall MoE's output. We also show that dormant experts can serve as dominating experts to manipulate model predictions. Accordingly, our attack, namely BadMoE, exploits the unique architecture of MoE models by 1) identifying dormant experts unrelated to the target task, 2) constructing a routing-aware loss to optimize the activation triggers of these experts, and 3) promoting dormant experts to dominating roles via poisoned training data. Extensive experiments show that BadMoE successfully enforces malicious prediction on attackers' target tasks while preserving overall model utility, making it a more potent and stealthy attack than existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to malicious attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we unveil a critical yet overlooked risk: LLM-powered agents can be strategically deployed to attack ID-free recommenders, stealthily promoting low-quality items in black-box settings. This attack exploits a novel rewriting-based deception strategy, where malicious agents synthesize deceptive textual descriptions by simulating the characteristics of popular items. To achieve this, the attack mechanism integrates two primary components: (1) a popularity extraction component that captures essential characteristics of popular items and (2) a multi-agent collaboration mechanism that enables iterative refinement of promotional textual descriptions through independent thinking and team discussion. To counter this risk, we further introduce a detection method to identify suspicious text generated by our discovered attack. By unveiling this risk, our work aims to underscore the urgent need to enhance the security of ID-free recommender systems.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Prompt Injection Attack to Tool Selection in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19793v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. The process operates through a two-step mechanism - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection). Our experimental results indicate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Les Dissonances: Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting in Multi-Tool Empowered LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03111v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are autonomous systems powered by LLMs, capable of reasoning and planning to solve problems by leveraging a set of tools. However, the integration of multi-tool capabilities in LLM agents introduces challenges in securely managing tools, ensuring their compatibility, handling dependency relationships, and protecting control flows within LLM agent workflows. In this paper, we present the first systematic security analysis of task control flows in multi-tool-enabled LLM agents. We identify a novel threat, Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting (XTHP), which includes multiple attack vectors to first hijack the normal control flows of agent tasks, and then collect and pollute confidential or private information within LLM agent systems. To understand the impact of this threat, we developed Chord, a dynamic scanning tool designed to automatically detect real-world agent tools susceptible to XTHP attacks. Our evaluation of 66 real-world tools from the repositories of two major LLM agent development frameworks, LangChain and LlamaIndex, revealed a significant security concern: 75\% are vulnerable to XTHP attacks, highlighting the prevalence of this threat.</p></details> |  |

Although existing identifier substitution attackers demonstrate high success rates, they often produce adversarial examples with unnatural code patterns. In this paper, we systematically assess the quality of adversarial examples using LLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that over 80% of adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art identifier substitution attackers (e.g., ALERT) are actually detectable. Based on this insight, we propose EP-Shield, a unified framework for evaluating and purifying identifier substitution attacks via naturalness-aware reasoning. Specifically, we first evaluate the naturalness of code and identify the perturbed adversarial code, then purify it so that the victim model can restore correct prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EP-Shield over adversarial fine-tuning (up to 83.36% improvement) and its lightweight design 7B parameters) with GPT-4-level performance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

However, due to the lack of systematic integration and utilization of knowledge, existing PIDSes still require significant manual intervention for practical deployment, making full automation challenging. This paper presents a disruptive innovation by categorizing PIDSes according to the types of knowledge they utilize. In response to the prevalent issue of ``knowledge silos problem'' in existing research, we introduce a novel knowledge-driven provenance-based intrusion detection framework, powered by large language models (LLMs). We also present OmniSec, a best practice system built upon this framework. By integrating attack representation knowledge, threat intelligence knowledge, and benign behavior knowledge, OmniSec outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on public benchmark datasets. OmniSec is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIDS-with-LLM-613B.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how a wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using a simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only a few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT-4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCIT: Reconstructing Full Private Data from Gradient in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20570v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical solution for adapting large language models (LLMs) to custom datasets with significantly reduced computational cost. When carrying out PEFT under collaborative learning scenarios (e.g., federated learning), it is often required to exchange model updates (or gradients) across parties. These gradients, even with limited dimensions, can cause severe breach of data privacy. Recent works have shown that both contextual prefixes and personally identifiable information (PII) can be exposed through gradients. However, \emph{simultaneously} and \emph{accurately} recovering both components from the same training instance remains infeasible due to the following challenges: 1) limited number of PEFT parameters; 2) high-dimensional token spaces; and 3) large batch sizes. We propose ReCIT, a novel privacy attack that addresses all challenges, and achieves recovery of \emph{full} private data from PEFT gradients with high fidelity. Specifically, ReCIT proposes to enhance the memorization capability of the pre-trained model through malicious fine-tuning with Personal Notes; ReCIT also proposes a novel filter-based token extraction technique and a token pairing mechanism, to accurately reconstruct tokens from the training sequences with large batch sizes. Extensive evaluations show that ReCIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art gradient inversion and memorization-based attacks across different PEFT paradigms. It achieves up to 10$\times$ higher PII recovery rates and remains effective across varying batch sizes, especially in settings where prefix reconstruction is intractable for conventional approaches. These findings highlight an urgent need to reassess the privacy guarantees of PEFT, especially in decentralized or shared training environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Attention Analysis for Backdoor Detection in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20518v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers implant stealthy textual triggers to manipulate model outputs. Previous backdoor detection methods primarily focus on the static features of backdoor samples. However, a vital property of diffusion models is their inherent dynamism. This study introduces a novel backdoor detection perspective named Dynamic Attention Analysis (DAA), showing that these dynamic characteristics serve as better indicators for backdoor detection. Specifically, by examining the dynamic evolution of cross-attention maps, we observe that backdoor samples exhibit distinct feature evolution patterns at the $<$EOS$>$ token compared to benign samples. To quantify these dynamic anomalies, we first introduce DAA-I, which treats the tokens' attention maps as spatially independent and measures dynamic feature using the Frobenius norm. Furthermore, to better capture the interactions between attention maps and refine the feature, we propose a dynamical system-based approach, referred to as DAA-S. This model formulates the spatial correlations among attention maps using a graph-based state equation and we theoretically analyze the global asymptotic stability of this method. Extensive experiments across five representative backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses existing detection methods, achieving an average F1 Score of 79.49% and an AUC of 87.67%.

Extensive research over several decades has shown how to attack stream ciphers based on this model and has identified the security properties required of the Boolean function used as the filtering function to resist such attacks. This led to the problem of constructing Boolean functions which provide adequate security \textit{and} at the same time are efficient to implement. Unfortunately, over the last two decades no good solutions to this problem appeared in the literature. The lack of good solutions has effectively led to nonlinear filter model becoming more or less obsolete. This is a big loss to the cryptographic design toolkit, since the great advantages of the nonlinear filter model are its simplicity, well understood security and the potential to provide low cost solutions for hardware oriented stream ciphers. In this paper, we revive the nonlinear filter model by constructing appropriate Boolean functions which provide required security and are also efficient to implement. We put forward concrete suggestions of stream ciphers which are $\kappa$-bit secure against known types of attacks for $\kappa=80,128,160,192,224$ and $256$. For the $80$-bit, $128$-bit, and the $256$-bit security levels, the circuits for the corresponding stream ciphers require about 1743.5, 2771.5, and 5607.5 NAND gates respectively. For the $80$-bit and the $128$-bit security levels, the gate count estimates compare quite well to the famous ciphers Trivium and Grain-128a respectively, while for the $256$-bit security level, we do not know of any other stream cipher design which has such a low gate count.</p></details> |  |
| **[Twin Auto-Encoder Model for Learning Separable Representation in Cyberattack Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15509v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning (RL) methods for cyberattack detection face the diversity and sophistication of attack data, leading to the issue of mixed representations of different classes, particularly as the number of classes increases. To address this, the paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture/model called the Twin Auto-Encoder (TAE). TAE first maps the input data into latent space and then deterministically shifts data samples of different classes further apart to create separable data representations, referred to as representation targets. TAE's decoder then projects the input data into these representation targets. After training, TAE's decoder extracts data representations. TAE's representation target serves as a novel dynamic codeword, which refers to the vector that represents a specific class. This vector is updated after each training epoch for every data sample, in contrast to the conventional fixed codeword that does not incorporate information from the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse cybersecurity datasets, including seven IoT botnet datasets, two network IDS datasets, three malware datasets, one cloud DDoS dataset, and ten artificial datasets as the number of classes increases. TAE boosts accuracy and F-score in attack detection by around 2% compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 96.1% average accuracy in IoT attack detection. Additionally, TAE is well-suited for cybersecurity applications and potentially for IoT systems, with a model size of approximately 1 MB and an average running time of around 2.6E-07 seconds for extracting a data sample.</p></details> |  |

Traditional cybersecurity approaches, often based on static rules and predefined scenarios, are struggling to adapt to the rapidly evolving nature of modern cyberattacks. There is an urgent need for more adaptive and intelligent defence strategies. The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) provides an innovative solution to cope with the increasingly severe cyber threats, and its potential in analysing complex attack patterns, predicting threats and assisting real-time response has attracted a lot of attention in the field of cybersecurity, and exploring how to effectively use LLM to defend against cyberattacks has become a hot topic in the current research field. This survey examines the applications of LLM from the perspective of the cyber attack lifecycle, focusing on the three phases of defense reconnaissance, foothold establishment, and lateral movement, and it analyzes the potential of LLMs in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. Meanwhile, we investigate how LLM-based security solutions are deployed and applied in different network scenarios. It also summarizes the internal and external risk issues faced by LLM during its application. Finally, this survey also points out the facing risk issues and possible future research directions in this domain.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

Although existing identifier substitution attackers demonstrate high success rates, they often produce adversarial examples with unnatural code patterns. In this paper, we systematically assess the quality of adversarial examples using LLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that over 80% of adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art identifier substitution attackers (e.g., ALERT) are actually detectable. Based on this insight, we propose EP-Shield, a unified framework for evaluating and purifying identifier substitution attacks via naturalness-aware reasoning. Specifically, we first evaluate the naturalness of code and identify the perturbed adversarial code, then purify it so that the victim model can restore correct prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EP-Shield over adversarial fine-tuning (up to 83.36% improvement) and its lightweight design 7B parameters) with GPT-4-level performance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

However, these autoregressive steganography approaches have certain limitations. Firstly, existing methods require encoding candidate words according to their output probability and generating each stego word one by one, which makes the generation process time-consuming. Secondly, encoding and selecting candidate words changes the sampling probabilities, resulting in poor imperceptibility of the stego text. Thirdly, existing methods have low robustness and cannot resist replacement attacks. To address these issues, we propose a generative text steganography method based on a diffusion model (GTSD), which improves generative speed, robustness, and imperceptibility while maintaining security. To be specific, a novel steganography scheme based on diffusion model is proposed to embed secret information through prompt mapping and batch mapping. The prompt mapping maps secret information into a conditional prompt to guide the pre-trained diffusion model generating batches of candidate sentences. The batch mapping selects stego text based on secret information from batches of candidate sentences. Extensive experiments show that the GTSD outperforms the SOTA method in terms of generative speed, robustness, and imperceptibility while maintaining comparable anti-steganalysis performance. Moreover, we verify that the GTSD has strong potential: embedding capacity is positively correlated with prompt capacity and model batch sizes while maintaining security.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where specially crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful or unsafe content. Such vulnerabilities undermine the reliability and security of simulation based applications. In this paper, we propose T2VShield, a comprehensive and model agnostic defense framework designed to protect text to video models from jailbreak threats. Our method systematically analyzes the input, model, and output stages to identify the limitations of existing defenses, including semantic ambiguities in prompts, difficulties in detecting malicious content in dynamic video outputs, and inflexible model centric mitigation strategies. T2VShield introduces a prompt rewriting mechanism based on reasoning and multimodal retrieval to sanitize malicious inputs, along with a multi scope detection module that captures local and global inconsistencies across time and modalities. The framework does not require access to internal model parameters and works with both open and closed source systems. Extensive experiments on five platforms show that T2VShield can reduce jailbreak success rates by up to 35 percent compared to strong baselines. We further develop a human centered audiovisual evaluation protocol to assess perceptual safety, emphasizing the importance of visual level defense in enhancing the trustworthiness of next generation multimodal simulators.</p></details> | 33 pages, 9 figures |

AI-based detection methods can help mitigate these risks; however, the performance of such models is inherently dependent on the quality and diversity of their training data. Presently, the available datasets are heavily skewed towards English and Chinese audio, which limits the global applicability of these anti-spoofing systems. To address this limitation, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset (MLAAD), created using 91 TTS models, comprising 42 different architectures, to generate 420.7 hours of synthetic voice in 38 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD and observe that it demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild and Fake-Or-Real when used as a training resource. Moreover, compared to the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, each excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD and making a trained model accessible via an interactive webserver, we aim to democratize anti-spoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of specialists, and contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and deepfakes.</p></details> | IJCNN 2024 |

In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how a wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using a simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only a few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT-4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCIT: Reconstructing Full Private Data from Gradient in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20570v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical solution for adapting large language models (LLMs) to custom datasets with significantly reduced computational cost. When carrying out PEFT under collaborative learning scenarios (e.g., federated learning), it is often required to exchange model updates (or gradients) across parties. These gradients, even with limited dimensions, can cause severe breach of data privacy. Recent works have shown that both contextual prefixes and personally identifiable information (PII) can be exposed through gradients. However, \emph{simultaneously} and \emph{accurately} recovering both components from the same training instance remains infeasible due to the following challenges: 1) limited number of PEFT parameters; 2) high-dimensional token spaces; and 3) large batch sizes. We propose ReCIT, a novel privacy attack that addresses all challenges, and achieves recovery of \emph{full} private data from PEFT gradients with high fidelity. Specifically, ReCIT proposes to enhance the memorization capability of the pre-trained model through malicious fine-tuning with Personal Notes; ReCIT also proposes a novel filter-based token extraction technique and a token pairing mechanism, to accurately reconstruct tokens from the training sequences with large batch sizes. Extensive evaluations show that ReCIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art gradient inversion and memorization-based attacks across different PEFT paradigms. It achieves up to 10$\times$ higher PII recovery rates and remains effective across varying batch sizes, especially in settings where prefix reconstruction is intractable for conventional approaches. These findings highlight an urgent need to reassess the privacy guarantees of PEFT, especially in decentralized or shared training environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Attention Analysis for Backdoor Detection in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20518v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers implant stealthy textual triggers to manipulate model outputs. Previous backdoor detection methods primarily focus on the static features of backdoor samples. However, a vital property of diffusion models is their inherent dynamism. This study introduces a novel backdoor detection perspective named Dynamic Attention Analysis (DAA), showing that these dynamic characteristics serve as better indicators for backdoor detection. Specifically, by examining the dynamic evolution of cross-attention maps, we observe that backdoor samples exhibit distinct feature evolution patterns at the $<$EOS$>$ token compared to benign samples. To quantify these dynamic anomalies, we first introduce DAA-I, which treats the tokens' attention maps as spatially independent and measures dynamic feature using the Frobenius norm. Furthermore, to better capture the interactions between attention maps and refine the feature, we propose a dynamical system-based approach, referred to as DAA-S. This model formulates the spatial correlations among attention maps using a graph-based state equation and we theoretically analyze the global asymptotic stability of this method. Extensive experiments across five representative backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses existing detection methods, achieving an average F1 Score of 79.49% and an AUC of 87.67%. The code is available at https://github.com/Robin-WZQ/DAA.</p></details> |  |
