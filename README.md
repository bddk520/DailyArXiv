| **[Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08646v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP-2025</p></details> |
| **[Guided Reasoning in LLM-Driven Penetration Testing Using Structured Attack Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07939v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems. Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and 78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Attacks of Social Engineering in Multi-turn Conversations: LLM Agents for Simulation and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15552v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of conversational agents, particularly chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), poses a significant risk of social engineering (SE) attacks on social media platforms. SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the SE attack mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a paper at COLM 2025 Workshop on AI Agents: Capabilities and Safety</p></details> |
| **[Attacking LLMs and AI Agents: Advertisement Embedding Attacks Against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17674v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Advertisement Embedding Attacks (AEA), a new class of LLM security threats that stealthily inject promotional or malicious content into model outputs and AI agents. AEA operate through two low-cost vectors: (1) hijacking third-party service-distribution platforms to prepend adversarial prompts, and (2) publishing back-doored open-source checkpoints fine-tuned with attacker data. Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Are Your LLM-based Text-to-SQL Models Secure? Exploring SQL Injection via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[AttestLLM: Efficient Attestation Framework for Billion-scale On-device LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06326v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As on-device LLMs(e.g., Apple on-device Intelligence) are widely adopted to reduce network dependency, improve privacy, and enhance responsiveness, verifying the legitimacy of models running on local devices becomes critical. Existing attestation techniques are not suitable for billion-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs), struggling to remain both time- and memory-efficient while addressing emerging threats in the LLM era. In this paper, we present AttestLLM, the first-of-its-kind attestation framework to protect the hardware-level intellectual property (IP) of device vendors by ensuring that only authorized LLMs can execute on target platforms. AttestLLM leverages an algorithm/software/hardware co-design approach to embed robust watermarking signatures onto the activation distributions of LLM building blocks. It also optimizes the attestation protocol within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), providing efficient verification without compromising inference throughput. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations on LLMs from Llama, Qwen, and Phi families for on-device use cases demonstrate AttestLLM's attestation reliability, fidelity, and efficiency. Furthermore, AttestLLM enforces model legitimacy and exhibits resilience against model replacement and forgery attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Prompt Injection Attacks: Risks and Defenses for Modern LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05883v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in recent years, with industries increasingly relying on them to maintain a competitive advantage. These models excel at interpreting user instructions and generating human-like responses, leading to their integration across diverse domains, including consulting and information retrieval. However, their widespread deployment also introduces substantial security risks, most notably in the form of prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. To systematically evaluate LLM vulnerabilities -- particularly to external prompt injection -- we conducted a series of experiments on eight commercial models. Each model was tested without supplementary sanitization, relying solely on its built-in safeguards. The results exposed exploitable weaknesses and emphasized the need for stronger security measures. Four categories of attacks were examined: direct injection, indirect (external) injection, image-based injection, and prompt leakage. Comparative analysis indicated that Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness; nevertheless, empirical findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain necessary to achieve reliable protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in Web Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05831v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as <meta>, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</p></details> |  |

| **[Securing Cryptographic Software via Typed Assembly Language (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08727v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Authors of cryptographic software are well aware that their code should not leak secrets through its timing behavior, and, until 2018, they believed that following industry-standard constant-time coding guidelines was sufficient. However, the revelation of the Spectre family of speculative execution attacks injected new complexities. To block speculative attacks, prior work has proposed annotating the program's source code to mark secret data, with hardware using this information to decide when to speculate (i.e., when only public values are involved) or not (when secrets are in play). While these solutions are able to track secret information stored on the heap, they suffer from limitations that prevent them from correctly tracking secrets on the stack, at a cost in performance. This paper introduces SecSep, a transformation framework that rewrites assembly programs so that they partition secret and public data on the stack. By moving from the source-code level to assembly rewriting, SecSep is able to address limitations of prior work. The key challenge in performing this assembly rewriting stems from the loss of semantic information through the lengthy compilation process. The key innovation of our methodology is a new variant of typed assembly language (TAL), Octal, which allows us to address this challenge. Assembly rewriting is driven by compile-time inference within Octal. We apply our technique to cryptographic programs and demonstrate that it enables secure speculation efficiently, incurring a low average overhead of $1.2\%$.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP-2025</p></details> |

The analysis shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect detectors, it can be sub-optimal in the long run to employ defensive responses while under attack; that is, depending on attack dynamics and response effectiveness, the total overhead of ongoing defensive countermeasures can exceed the total risk of intermittent security failures. The analysis similarly examines the availability loss versus the risk reduction of employing preemptive resets, isolating key factors that determine whether system recovery is best initiated reactively or proactively. We also discuss model extensions and related work looking towards intrusion tolerance applications with (i) imperfect or controllable detectors, (ii) multiple types of attacks, (iii) continuous-time dynamics or (iv) strategic attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, unpublished/rejected manuscript circa 2010</p></details> |

While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions, and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills. DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection accuracy of 99.70%.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional attacks that degrade accuracy, AEA subvert information integrity, causing models to return covert ads, propaganda, or hate speech while appearing normal. We detail the attack pipeline, map five stakeholder victim groups, and present an initial prompt-based self-inspection defense that mitigates these injections without additional model retraining. Our findings reveal an urgent, under-addressed gap in LLM security and call for coordinated detection, auditing, and policy responses from the AI-safety community.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

However, the revelation of the Spectre family of speculative execution attacks injected new complexities. To block speculative attacks, prior work has proposed annotating the program's source code to mark secret data, with hardware using this information to decide when to speculate (i.e., when only public values are involved) or not (when secrets are in play). While these solutions are able to track secret information stored on the heap, they suffer from limitations that prevent them from correctly tracking secrets on the stack, at a cost in performance. This paper introduces SecSep, a transformation framework that rewrites assembly programs so that they partition secret and public data on the stack. By moving from the source-code level to assembly rewriting, SecSep is able to address limitations of prior work. The key challenge in performing this assembly rewriting stems from the loss of semantic information through the lengthy compilation process. The key innovation of our methodology is a new variant of typed assembly language (TAL), Octal, which allows us to address this challenge. Assembly rewriting is driven by compile-time inference within Octal. We apply our technique to cryptographic programs and demonstrate that it enables secure speculation efficiently, incurring a low average overhead of $1.2\%$.</p></details> |  |
