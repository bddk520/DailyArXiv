| **[Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03710v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

| **[A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

However, despite these achievements, LLMs still exhibit inherent safety vulnerabilities, especially when confronted with jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods suffer from two main limitations: reliance on complicated prompt engineering and iterative optimization, which lead to low attack success rate (ASR) and attack efficiency (AE). In this work, we propose an efficient jailbreak attack method, Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ), which leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLMs to autonomously generate harmful content, revealing their underlying safety vulnerabilities during complex reasoning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs. In particular, ABJ achieves high ASR (82.1% on GPT-4o-2024-11-20) with exceptional AE among all target LLMs, showcasing its remarkable attack effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency. Our findings underscore the urgent need to prioritize and improve the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Knowledge is All You Need: Last Mile Delivery for Automated Provenance-based Intrusion Detection with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03108v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes) have been widely proposed for endpoint threat analysis. However, due to the lack of systematic integration and utilization of knowledge, existing PIDSes still require significant manual intervention for practical deployment, making full automation challenging. This paper presents a disruptive innovation by categorizing PIDSes according to the types of knowledge they utilize. In response to the prevalent issue of ``knowledge silos problem'' in existing research, we introduce a novel knowledge-driven provenance-based intrusion detection framework, powered by large language models (LLMs). We also present OmniSec, a best practice system built upon this framework. By integrating attack representation knowledge, threat intelligence knowledge, and benign behavior knowledge, OmniSec outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on public benchmark datasets. OmniSec is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIDS-with-LLM-613B.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Misalignment via Adversarial RLHF Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03039v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards developing RLHF platforms. These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms. While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored. Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools. In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset. In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target. This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Safety Evaluations Lack Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02574v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we argue that current safety alignment research efforts for large language models are hindered by many intertwined sources of noise, such as small datasets, methodological inconsistencies, and unreliable evaluation setups. This can, at times, make it impossible to evaluate and compare attacks and defenses fairly, thereby slowing progress. We systematically analyze the LLM safety evaluation pipeline, covering dataset curation, optimization strategies for automated red-teaming, response generation, and response evaluation using LLM judges. At each stage, we identify key issues and highlight their practical impact. We also propose a set of guidelines for reducing noise and bias in evaluations of future attack and defense papers. Lastly, we offer an opposing perspective, highlighting practical reasons for existing limitations. We believe that addressing the outlined problems in future research will improve the field's ability to generate easily comparable results and make measurable progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Attacks Break Defenses Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00061v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit remarkable performance across diverse applications by using external tools to interact with environments. However, integrating external tools introduces security risks, such as indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks. Despite defenses designed for IPI attacks, their robustness remains questionable due to insufficient testing against adaptive attacks. In this paper, we evaluate eight different defenses and bypass all of them using adaptive attacks, consistently achieving an attack success rate of over 50%. This reveals critical vulnerabilities in current defenses. Our research underscores the need for adaptive attack evaluation when designing defenses to ensure robustness and reliability. The code is available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/AdaptiveAttackAgent.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables (NAACL 2025 Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Confidential Prompting: Protecting User Prompts from Cloud LLM Providers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19134v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work tackles the challenge of securing user inputs in cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) serving while ensuring model confidentiality, output invariance, and compute efficiency. We introduce Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD), which uses confidential computing to confine user prompts to a trusted execution environment (TEE), namely a confidential virtual machine (CVM), while allowing service providers to generate tokens efficiently. We also introduce a novel cryptographic method, Prompt Obfuscation (PO), to ensure robustness against reconstruction attacks on SPD. We demonstrate our approach preserves both prompt confidentiality and LLM serving efficiency. Our solution enables privacy-preserving cloud LLM serving that handles sensitive prompts, such as clinical records, financial data, and personal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAPILLON: Efficient and Stealthy Fuzz Testing-Powered Jailbreaks for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866v5)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs. In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.

| **[Optimization-based Prompt Injection Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17710v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-as-a-Judge uses a large language model (LLM) to select the best response from a set of candidates for a given question. LLM-as-a-Judge has many applications such as LLM-powered search, reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), and tool selection. In this work, we propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. Our results show these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/ShiJiawenwen/JudgeDeceiver.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of The ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), 2024</p></details> |

| **[Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424v4)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoBAM: LoRA-Based Backdoor Attack on Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16746v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is an emerging technique that integrates multiple models fine-tuned on different tasks to create a versatile model that excels in multiple domains. This scheme, in the meantime, may open up backdoor attack opportunities where one single malicious model can jeopardize the integrity of the merged model. Existing works try to demonstrate the risk of such attacks by assuming substantial computational resources, focusing on cases where the attacker can fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. Such an assumption, however, may not be feasible given the increasing size of machine learning models. In practice where resources are limited and the attacker can only employ techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to produce the malicious model, it remains unclear whether the attack can still work and pose threats. In this work, we first identify that the attack efficacy is significantly diminished when using LoRA for fine-tuning. Then, we propose LoBAM, a method that yields high attack success rate with minimal training resources. The key idea of LoBAM is to amplify the malicious weights in an intelligent way that effectively enhances the attack efficacy. We demonstrate that our design can lead to improved attack success rate through extensive empirical experiments across various model merging scenarios. Moreover, we show that our method is highly stealthy and is difficult to detect and defend against.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttackSeqBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Understanding of Sequential Patterns in Cyber Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03170v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The observations documented in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports play a critical role in describing adversarial behaviors, providing valuable insights for security practitioners to respond to evolving threats. Recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various cybersecurity applications, including CTI report understanding and attack knowledge graph construction. While previous works have proposed benchmarks that focus on the CTI extraction ability of LLMs, the sequential characteristic of adversarial behaviors within CTI reports remains largely unexplored, which holds considerable significance in developing a comprehensive understanding of how adversaries operate. To address this gap, we introduce AttackSeqBench, a benchmark tailored to systematically evaluate LLMs' capability to understand and reason attack sequences in CTI reports. Our benchmark encompasses three distinct Question Answering (QA) tasks, each task focuses on the varying granularity in adversarial behavior. To alleviate the laborious effort of QA construction, we carefully design an automated dataset construction pipeline to create scalable and well-formulated QA datasets based on real-world CTI reports. To ensure the quality of our dataset, we adopt a hybrid approach of combining human evaluation and systematic evaluation metrics. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis with both fast-thinking and slow-thinking LLMs, while highlighting their strengths and limitations in analyzing the sequential patterns in cyber attacks. The overarching goal of this work is to provide a benchmark that advances LLM-driven CTI report understanding and fosters its application in real-world cybersecurity operations. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Javiery3889/AttackSeqBench .</p></details> |  |
| **[An Undetectable Watermark for Generative Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07369v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first undetectable watermarking scheme for generative image models. Undetectability ensures that no efficient adversary can distinguish between watermarked and un-watermarked images, even after making many adaptive queries. In particular, an undetectable watermark does not degrade image quality under any efficiently computable metric. Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to every prior scheme we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks.

However, their deployment in clinical practice raises significant safety concerns, including the potential spread of harmful information. This study systematically assesses the vulnerabilities of seven LLMs to three advanced black-box jailbreaking techniques within medical contexts. To quantify the effectiveness of these techniques, we propose an automated and domain-adapted agentic evaluation pipeline. Experiment results indicate that leading commercial and open-source LLMs are highly vulnerable to medical jailbreaking attacks. To bolster model safety and reliability, we further investigate the effectiveness of Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) in defending against medical adversarial attacks. Our findings underscore the necessity for evolving attack methods evaluation, domain-specific safety alignment, and LLM safety-utility balancing. This research offers actionable insights for advancing the safety and reliability of AI clinicians, contributing to ethical and effective AI deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPIA: Towards Target-specific Prompt Injection Attack against Code-oriented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v5)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully exploited to simplify and facilitate programming. Unfortunately, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former poisons the training data or model parameters, hijacking the LLMs to generate malicious code snippets when encountering the trigger. The latter crafts malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of the generated codes. In this paper, we reveal that both attacks have some inherent limitations: backdoor attacks rely on the adversary's capability of controlling the model training process, which may not be practical; adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a novel attack paradigm against Code LLMs, namely target-specific prompt injection attack (TPIA). TPIA generates non-functional perturbations containing the information of malicious instructions and inserts them into the victim's code context by spreading them into potentially used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base). It induces the Code LLMs to generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at the target location. In general, we compress the attacker-specified malicious objective into the perturbation by adversarial optimization based on greedy token search. We collect 13 representative malicious objectives to design 31 threat cases for three popular programming languages. We show that our TPIA can successfully attack three representative open-source Code LLMs (with an attack success rate of up to 97.9%) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with an attack success rate of over 90%) in all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional perturbation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CL methods often focus on knowledge transfer from a known model to a new one, overlooking the existence of unknown black-box models. We explore a novel multi-robot CL approach that enables knowledge transfer from black-box VPR models (teachers), such as those of local robots encountered by traveler robots (students) in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce Membership Inference Attack, or MIA, the only major privacy attack applicable to black-box models, and leverage it to reconstruct pseudo training sets, which serve as the key knowledge to be exchanged between robots, from black-box VPR models. Furthermore, we aim to overcome the inherently low sampling efficiency of MIA by leveraging insights on place class prediction distribution and un-learned class detection imported from the VPR literature as a prior distribution. We also analyze both the individual effects of these methods and their combined impact. Experimental results demonstrate that our black-box MIA (BB-MIA) approach is remarkably powerful despite its simplicity, significantly enhancing the VPR capability of lower-performing robots through brief communication with other robots. This study contributes to optimizing knowledge sharing between robots in VPR and enhancing autonomy in open-world environments with multi-robot systems that are fault-tolerant and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |
| **[A Lightweight and Secure Deep Learning Model for Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning in Intelligent Enterprises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02017v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever growing Internet of Things (IoT) connections drive a new type of organization, the Intelligent Enterprise. In intelligent enterprises, machine learning based models are adopted to extract insights from data. Due to the efficiency and privacy challenges of these traditional models, a new federated learning (FL) paradigm has emerged. In FL, multiple enterprises can jointly train a model to update a final model. However, firstly, FL trained models usually perform worse than centralized models, especially when enterprises training data is non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed). Second, due to the centrality of FL and the untrustworthiness of local enterprises, traditional FL solutions are vulnerable to poisoning and inference attacks and violate privacy. Thirdly, the continuous transfer of parameters between enterprises and servers increases communication costs. To this end, the FedAnil+ model is proposed, a novel, lightweight, and secure Federated Deep Learning Model that includes three main phases. In the first phase, the goal is to solve the data type distribution skew challenge. Addressing privacy concerns against poisoning and inference attacks is covered in the second phase. Finally, to alleviate the communication overhead, a novel compression approach is proposed that significantly reduces the size of the updates. The experiment results validate that FedAnil+ is secure against inference and poisoning attacks with better accuracy. In addition, it shows improvements over existing approaches in terms of model accuracy (13%, 16%, and 26%), communication cost (17%, 21%, and 25%), and computation cost (7%, 9%, and 11%).</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, IEEE Internet of Things Journal (2024)</p></details> |

However, despite these achievements, LLMs still exhibit inherent safety vulnerabilities, especially when confronted with jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods suffer from two main limitations: reliance on complicated prompt engineering and iterative optimization, which lead to low attack success rate (ASR) and attack efficiency (AE). In this work, we propose an efficient jailbreak attack method, Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ), which leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLMs to autonomously generate harmful content, revealing their underlying safety vulnerabilities during complex reasoning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs. In particular, ABJ achieves high ASR (82.1% on GPT-4o-2024-11-20) with exceptional AE among all target LLMs, showcasing its remarkable attack effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency. Our findings underscore the urgent need to prioritize and improve the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Safe GenAI Applications: An End-to-End Overview of Red Teaming for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01742v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant privacy, security, and ethical concerns. While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoBAM: LoRA-Based Backdoor Attack on Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16746v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is an emerging technique that integrates multiple models fine-tuned on different tasks to create a versatile model that excels in multiple domains. This scheme, in the meantime, may open up backdoor attack opportunities where one single malicious model can jeopardize the integrity of the merged model. Existing works try to demonstrate the risk of such attacks by assuming substantial computational resources, focusing on cases where the attacker can fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. Such an assumption, however, may not be feasible given the increasing size of machine learning models. In practice where resources are limited and the attacker can only employ techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to produce the malicious model, it remains unclear whether the attack can still work and pose threats. In this work, we first identify that the attack efficacy is significantly diminished when using LoRA for fine-tuning. Then, we propose LoBAM, a method that yields high attack success rate with minimal training resources. The key idea of LoBAM is to amplify the malicious weights in an intelligent way that effectively enhances the attack efficacy. We demonstrate that our design can lead to improved attack success rate through extensive empirical experiments across various model merging scenarios. Moreover, we show that our method is highly stealthy and is difficult to detect and defend against.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttackSeqBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Understanding of Sequential Patterns in Cyber Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03170v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The observations documented in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports play a critical role in describing adversarial behaviors, providing valuable insights for security practitioners to respond to evolving threats. Recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various cybersecurity applications, including CTI report understanding and attack knowledge graph construction. While previous works have proposed benchmarks that focus on the CTI extraction ability of LLMs, the sequential characteristic of adversarial behaviors within CTI reports remains largely unexplored, which holds considerable significance in developing a comprehensive understanding of how adversaries operate. To address this gap, we introduce AttackSeqBench, a benchmark tailored to systematically evaluate LLMs' capability to understand and reason attack sequences in CTI reports. Our benchmark encompasses three distinct Question Answering (QA) tasks, each task focuses on the varying granularity in adversarial behavior. To alleviate the laborious effort of QA construction, we carefully design an automated dataset construction pipeline to create scalable and well-formulated QA datasets based on real-world CTI reports. To ensure the quality of our dataset, we adopt a hybrid approach of combining human evaluation and systematic evaluation metrics. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis with both fast-thinking and slow-thinking LLMs, while highlighting their strengths and limitations in analyzing the sequential patterns in cyber attacks. The overarching goal of this work is to provide a benchmark that advances LLM-driven CTI report understanding and fosters its application in real-world cybersecurity operations. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Javiery3889/AttackSeqBench .</p></details> |  |
| **[An Undetectable Watermark for Generative Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07369v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first undetectable watermarking scheme for generative image models. Undetectability ensures that no efficient adversary can distinguish between watermarked and un-watermarked images, even after making many adaptive queries. In particular, an undetectable watermark does not degrade image quality under any efficiently computable metric. Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to every prior scheme we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks.
