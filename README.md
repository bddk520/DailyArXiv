| **[Commercial LLM Agents Are Already Vulnerable to Simple Yet Dangerous Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08586v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A high volume of recent ML security literature focuses on attacks against aligned large language models (LLMs). These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then conduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial agents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their vulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no understanding of machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modification and Generated-Text Detection: Achieving Dual Detection Capabilities for the Outputs of LLM by Watermark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08332v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse. One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction. Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM. This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification. We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection. When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification. Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM Serving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20002v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

| **[Efficient LLM Jailbreak via Adaptive Dense-to-sparse Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09113v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that can generate harmful content. This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which has been shown to successfully jailbreak multiple open-source LLMs. Drawing inspiration from the difficulties of discrete token optimization, our method relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization process while gradually increasing the sparsity of the optimizing vectors. This technique effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art token-level methods. On Harmbench, our approach achieves the highest attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs compared to the latest jailbreak methods. Trigger Warning: This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Adversarial Attack on Aligned Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07987v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., ''Sure, here it is'') or otherwise unsafe content-even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench benchmark, our method achieves significantly higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 93% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model transferability by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously and testing on unseen architectures. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license. Warning: some content generated by Multimodal LLMs in this paper may be offensive to some readers.</p></details> |  |
| **[AiRacleX: Automated Detection of Price Oracle Manipulations via LLM-Driven Knowledge Mining and Prompt Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06348v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications depend on accurate price oracles to ensure secure transactions, yet these oracles are highly vulnerable to manipulation, enabling attackers to exploit smart contract vulnerabilities for unfair asset valuation and financial gain. Detecting such manipulations traditionally relies on the manual effort of experienced experts, presenting significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-driven framework that automates the detection of price oracle manipulations by leveraging the complementary strengths of different LLM models (LLMs). Our approach begins with domain-specific knowledge extraction, where an LLM model synthesizes precise insights about price oracle vulnerabilities from top-tier academic papers, eliminating the need for profound expertise from developers or auditors. This knowledge forms the foundation for a second LLM model to generate structured, context-aware chain of thought prompts, which guide a third LLM model in accurately identifying manipulation patterns in smart contracts. We validate the effectiveness of framework through experiments on 60 known vulnerabilities from 46 real-world DeFi attacks or projects spanning 2021 to 2023. The best performing combination of LLMs (Haiku-Haiku-4o-mini) identified by AiRacleX demonstrate a 2.58-times improvement in recall (0.667 vs 0.259) compared to the state-of-the-art tool GPTScan, while maintaining comparable precision. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of replacing commercial models with open-source alternatives, enhancing privacy and security for developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUNAR: LLM Unlearning via Neural Activation Redirection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07218v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from training on ever larger amounts of textual data, but as a result, they increasingly incur the risk of leaking private information. The ability to selectively remove knowledge from LLMs is, therefore, a highly desirable capability. In this paper, we propose LUNAR, a novel unlearning methodology grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis. LUNAR operates by redirecting the representations of unlearned data to regions that trigger the model's inherent ability to express its inability to answer. LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance while significantly enhancing the controllability of the unlearned model during inference. Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x to 11.7x improvements on combined "unlearning efficacy" and "model utility" score ("Deviation Score") on the PISTOL dataset across various base models. We also demonstrate, through quantitative analysis and qualitative examples, LUNAR's superior controllability in generating coherent and contextually aware responses, mitigating undesired side effects of existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust against white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in handling real-world scenarios, such as processing sequential unlearning requests.</p></details> |  |

To address this concern, we present LLM Honeypot, a system designed to monitor autonomous AI hacking agents. By augmenting a standard SSH honeypot with prompt injection and time-based analysis techniques, our framework aims to distinguish LLM agents among all attackers. Over a trial deployment of about three months in a public environment, we collected 8,130,731 hacking attempts and 8 potential AI agents. Our work demonstrates the emergence of AI-driven threats and their current level of usage, serving as an early warning of malicious LLM agents in the wild.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00761v4)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after hundreds of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that progress on tamper-resistance is possible, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://www.tamper-resistant-safeguards.com</p></details> |

Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad applicability across various devices and platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation(Poster) at PPAI-25: The 6th AAAI Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in Customized Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02416v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to a new research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts, i.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs) play an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns about the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these services and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt memorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the scaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence prompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types of prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their prompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of LLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token translation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we investigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find that current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly vulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward user attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the inspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\% and 71.0\% drop in the prompt extraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

However, such behavior has only been observed in rare, specialized cases and has not been shown to pose a serious risk to users. Additionally, research on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models to refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally became honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce a novel attack that undermines both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have serious real-world consequences. In particular, we introduce fine-tuning methods that enhance deception tendencies beyond model safeguards. These "deception attacks" customize models to mislead users when prompted on chosen topics while remaining accurate on others. Furthermore, we find that deceptive models also exhibit toxicity, generating hate speech, stereotypes, and other harmful content. Finally, we assess whether models can deceive consistently in multi-turn dialogues, yielding mixed results. Given that millions of users interact with LLM-based chatbots, voice assistants, agents, and other interfaces where trustworthiness cannot be ensured, securing these models against deception attacks is critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Nonlinear Filter Model of Stream Cipher Redivivus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01110v4)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nonlinear filter model is an old and well understood approach to the design of secure stream ciphers. Extensive research over several decades has shown how to attack stream ciphers based on this model and has identified the security properties required of the Boolean function used as the filtering function to resist such attacks. This led to the problem of constructing Boolean functions which provide adequate security \textit{and} at the same time are efficient to implement. Unfortunately, over the last two decades no good solutions to this problem appeared in the literature. The lack of good solutions has effectively led to nonlinear filter model becoming more or less obsolete. This is a big loss to the cryptographic design toolkit, since the great advantages of the nonlinear filter model are its simplicity, well understood security and the potential to provide low cost solutions for hardware oriented stream ciphers. In this paper, we revive the nonlinear filter model by constructing appropriate Boolean functions which provide required security and are also efficient to implement. We put forward concrete suggestions of stream ciphers which are $\kappa$-bit secure against known types of attacks for $\kappa=80,128,160,192,224$ and $256$. For the $80$-bit, $128$-bit, and the $256$-bit security levels, the circuits for the corresponding stream ciphers require about 1743.5, 2771.5, and 5607.5 NAND gates respectively. For the $80$-bit and the $128$-bit security levels, the gate count estimates compare quite well to the famous ciphers Trivium and Grain-128a respectively, while for the $256$-bit security level, we do not know of any other stream cipher design which has such a low gate count.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Experience Replay Facilitates Safety Red-Teaming of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16769v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have shown remarkable progress, but their potential to generate harmful content remains a critical concern in the ML community. While various safety mechanisms have been developed, the field lacks systematic tools for evaluating their effectiveness against real-world misuse scenarios. In this work, we propose ICER, a novel red-teaming framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and a bandit optimization-based algorithm to generate interpretable and semantic meaningful problematic prompts by learning from past successful red-teaming attempts. Our ICER efficiently probes safety mechanisms across different T2I models without requiring internal access or additional training, making it broadly applicable to deployed systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICER significantly outperforms existing prompt attack methods in identifying model vulnerabilities while maintaining high semantic similarity with intended content. By uncovering that successful jailbreaking instances can systematically facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities, our work provides crucial insights for developing more robust safety mechanisms in T2I systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[BlueSuffix: Reinforced Blue Teaming for Vision-Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20971v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on black-box defense for VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Existing black-box defense methods are either unimodal or bimodal. Unimodal methods enhance either the vision or language module of the VLM, while bimodal methods robustify the model through text-image representation realignment. However, these methods suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to fully exploit the cross-modal information, or 2) they degrade the model performance on benign inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel blue-team method BlueSuffix that defends target VLMs against jailbreak attacks without compromising its performance under black-box setting. BlueSuffix includes three key components: 1) a visual purifier against jailbreak images, 2) a textual purifier against jailbreak texts, and 3) a blue-team suffix generator using reinforcement fine-tuning for enhancing cross-modal robustness. We empirically show on four VLMs (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, InstructionBLIP, and Gemini) and four safety benchmarks (Harmful Instruction, AdvBench, MM-SafetyBench, and RedTeam-2K) that BlueSuffix outperforms the baseline defenses by a significant margin. Our BlueSuffix opens up a promising direction for defending VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/Vinsonzyh/BlueSuffix.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Robustness and Accuracy in Mixture of Experts: A Dual-Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06832v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture of Experts (MoE) have shown remarkable success in leveraging specialized expert networks for complex machine learning tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents a critical challenge for deployment in robust applications. This paper addresses the critical question of how to incorporate robustness into MoEs while maintaining high natural accuracy. We begin by analyzing the vulnerability of MoE components, finding that expert networks are notably more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the router. Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training technique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial robustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert without compromising training or inference efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a dual-model strategy that linearly combines a standard MoE model with our robustified MoE model using a smoothing parameter. This approach allows for flexible control over the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We further provide theoretical foundations by deriving certified robustness bounds for both the single MoE and the dual-model. To push the boundaries of robustness and accuracy, we propose a novel joint training strategy JTDMoE for the dual-model. This joint training enhances both robustness and accuracy beyond what is achievable with separate models. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ICML 2025 (under review)</p></details> |

Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.04306</p></details> |
| **[MAA: Meticulous Adversarial Attack against Vision-Language Pre-trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08079v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current adversarial attacks for evaluating the robustness of vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models in multi-modal tasks suffer from limited transferability, where attacks crafted for a specific model often struggle to generalize effectively across different models, limiting their utility in assessing robustness more broadly. This is mainly attributed to the over-reliance on model-specific features and regions, particularly in the image modality. In this paper, we propose an elegant yet highly effective method termed Meticulous Adversarial Attack (MAA) to fully exploit model-independent characteristics and vulnerabilities of individual samples, achieving enhanced generalizability and reduced model dependence. MAA emphasizes fine-grained optimization of adversarial images by developing a novel resizing and sliding crop (RScrop) technique, incorporating a multi-granularity similarity disruption (MGSD) strategy. Extensive experiments across diverse VLP models, multiple benchmark datasets, and a variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MAA significantly enhances the effectiveness and transferability of adversarial attacks. A large cohort of performance studies is conducted to generate insights into the effectiveness of various model configurations, guiding future advancements in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in Customized Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02416v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to a new research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts, i.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs) play an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns about the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these services and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt memorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the scaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence prompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types of prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their prompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of LLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token translation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we investigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find that current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly vulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward user attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the inspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\% and 71.0\% drop in the prompt extraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

| **[Compromising Honesty and Harmlessness in Language Models via Deception Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08301v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated their ability to understand and employ deceptive behavior, even without explicit prompting. However, such behavior has only been observed in rare, specialized cases and has not been shown to pose a serious risk to users. Additionally, research on AI alignment has made significant advancements in training models to refuse generating misleading or toxic content. As a result, LLMs generally became honest and harmless. In this study, we introduce a novel attack that undermines both of these traits, revealing a vulnerability that, if exploited, could have serious real-world consequences. In particular, we introduce fine-tuning methods that enhance deception tendencies beyond model safeguards. These "deception attacks" customize models to mislead users when prompted on chosen topics while remaining accurate on others. Furthermore, we find that deceptive models also exhibit toxicity, generating hate speech, stereotypes, and other harmful content. Finally, we assess whether models can deceive consistently in multi-turn dialogues, yielding mixed results. Given that millions of users interact with LLM-based chatbots, voice assistants, agents, and other interfaces where trustworthiness cannot be ensured, securing these models against deception attacks is critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Nonlinear Filter Model of Stream Cipher Redivivus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01110v4)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nonlinear filter model is an old and well understood approach to the design of secure stream ciphers. Extensive research over several decades has shown how to attack stream ciphers based on this model and has identified the security properties required of the Boolean function used as the filtering function to resist such attacks. This led to the problem of constructing Boolean functions which provide adequate security \textit{and} at the same time are efficient to implement. Unfortunately, over the last two decades no good solutions to this problem appeared in the literature. The lack of good solutions has effectively led to nonlinear filter model becoming more or less obsolete. This is a big loss to the cryptographic design toolkit, since the great advantages of the nonlinear filter model are its simplicity, well understood security and the potential to provide low cost solutions for hardware oriented stream ciphers. In this paper, we revive the nonlinear filter model by constructing appropriate Boolean functions which provide required security and are also efficient to implement. We put forward concrete suggestions of stream ciphers which are $\kappa$-bit secure against known types of attacks for $\kappa=80,128,160,192,224$ and $256$. For the $80$-bit, $128$-bit, and the $256$-bit security levels, the circuits for the corresponding stream ciphers require about 1743.5, 2771.5, and 5607.5 NAND gates respectively. For the $80$-bit and the $128$-bit security levels, the gate count estimates compare quite well to the famous ciphers Trivium and Grain-128a respectively, while for the $256$-bit security level, we do not know of any other stream cipher design which has such a low gate count.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Experience Replay Facilitates Safety Red-Teaming of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16769v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have shown remarkable progress, but their potential to generate harmful content remains a critical concern in the ML community. While various safety mechanisms have been developed, the field lacks systematic tools for evaluating their effectiveness against real-world misuse scenarios. In this work, we propose ICER, a novel red-teaming framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and a bandit optimization-based algorithm to generate interpretable and semantic meaningful problematic prompts by learning from past successful red-teaming attempts. Our ICER efficiently probes safety mechanisms across different T2I models without requiring internal access or additional training, making it broadly applicable to deployed systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICER significantly outperforms existing prompt attack methods in identifying model vulnerabilities while maintaining high semantic similarity with intended content. By uncovering that successful jailbreaking instances can systematically facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities, our work provides crucial insights for developing more robust safety mechanisms in T2I systems.</p></details> |  |
