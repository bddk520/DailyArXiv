| **[Sockpuppetting: Jailbreaking LLMs Without Optimization Through Output Prefix Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13359v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As open-weight large language models (LLMs) increase in capabilities, safeguarding them against malicious prompts and understanding possible attack vectors becomes ever more important. While automated jailbreaking methods like GCG [Zou et al., 2023] remain effective, they often require substantial computational resources and specific expertise. We introduce "sockpuppetting'', a simple method for jailbreaking open-weight LLMs by inserting an acceptance sequence (e.g., "Sure, here is how to...'') at the start of a model's output and allowing it to complete the response. Requiring only a single line of code and no optimization, sockpuppetting achieves up to 80% higher attack success rate (ASR) than GCG on Qwen3-8B in per-prompt comparisons. We also explore a hybrid approach that optimizes the adversarial suffix within the assistant message block rather than the user prompt, increasing ASR by 64% over GCG on Llama-3.1-8B in a prompt-agnostic setting. The results establish sockpuppetting as an effective low-cost attack accessible to unsophisticated adversaries, highlighting the need for defences against output-prefix injection in open-weight models.</p></details> |  |
| **[OI-Bench: An Option Injection Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Susceptibility to Directive Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13300v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking large language models (LLMs) is critical for understanding their capabilities, limitations, and robustness. In addition to interface artifacts, prior studies have shown that LLM decisions can be influenced by directive signals such as social cues, framing, and instructions. In this work, we introduce option injection, a benchmarking approach that augments the multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) interface with an additional option containing a misleading directive, leveraging standardized choice structure and scalable evaluation. We construct OI-Bench, a benchmark of 3,000 questions spanning knowledge, reasoning, and commonsense tasks, with 16 directive types covering social compliance, bonus framing, threat framing, and instructional interference. This setting combines manipulation of the choice interface with directive-based interference, enabling systematic assessment of model susceptibility. We evaluate 12 LLMs to analyze attack success rates, behavioral responses, and further investigate mitigation strategies ranging from inference-time prompting to post-training alignment. Experimental results reveal substantial vulnerabilities and heterogeneous robustness across models. OI-Bench is expected to support more systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to directive interference within choice-based interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDLLM: A Dedicated Detector for Black-Box LLMs Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029v4)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.</p></details> |  |

Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft "adversarial news" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include "malicious" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points. To assess real-world feasibility, we analyze popular scraping libraries and trading platforms and survey 27 FinTech practitioners, confirming our hypotheses. We notified trading platform owners of this security issue.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML).

| **[From Defender to Devil? Unintended Risk Interactions Induced by LLM Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07968v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various applications, but their deployment in real-world settings faces several risks, including jailbreak attacks and privacy leaks. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been proposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation and ignore their effects on other risk dimensions. In this work, we introduce a new cross-risk evaluation paradigm and take the first step in investigating unintended interactions among defenses in LLMs. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between safety, fairness, and privacy. To this end, we propose CrossRiskEval, a framework that systematically characterizes how a defense designed for one risk (e.g., safety) affects others (e.g., fairness or privacy). We conduct extensive empirical studies and mechanistic analyses on 14 LLMs with deployed defenses, covering 12 defense strategies. Our results show that defenses targeting a single risk often cause measurable effects on other risks. These effects vary in direction and magnitude across a range of factors (e.g., models, tasks, and defense strategies), and are often asymmetric across risk pairs. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis shows that these interactions are not random: they arise from conflict-entangled neurons, which are shared internal representations that contribute in opposite ways to different risks. Adjusting one risk therefore perturbs these representations and leads to systematic changes in non-target risks. These findings reveal the limits of single-risk evaluation and highlight the need for holistic and interaction-aware assessment when designing and deploying LLM defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrojanPraise: Jailbreak LLMs via Benign Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12460v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand of customized large language models (LLMs) has led to commercial LLMs offering black-box fine-tuning APIs, yet this convenience introduces a critical security loophole: attackers could jailbreak the LLMs by fine-tuning them with malicious data. Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., "bruaf") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection: A Lightweight Defense Against Prompt Injections in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12359v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attacks have become an increasing vulnerability for LLM applications, where adversarial prompts exploit indirect input channels such as emails or user-generated content to circumvent alignment safeguards and induce harmful or unintended outputs. Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of <3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Lock-LLM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Taming Various Privilege Escalation in LLM-Based Agent Systems: A Mandatory Access Control Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11893v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent systems are increasingly deployed for complex real-world tasks but remain vulnerable to natural language-based attacks that exploit over-privileged tool use. This paper aims to understand and mitigate such attacks through the lens of privilege escalation, defined as agent actions exceeding the least privilege required for a user's intended task. Based on a formal model of LLM agent systems, we identify novel privilege escalation scenarios, particularly in multi-agent systems, including a variant akin to the classic confused deputy problem. To defend against both known and newly demonstrated privilege escalation, we propose SEAgent, a mandatory access control (MAC) framework built upon attribute-based access control (ABAC). SEAgent monitors agent-tool interactions via an information flow graph and enforces customizable security policies based on entity attributes. Our evaluations show that SEAgent effectively blocks various privilege escalation while maintaining a low false positive rate and negligible system overhead. This demonstrates its robustness and adaptability in securing LLM-based agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference on LLMs in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11314v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Max Tokens: Stealthy Resource Amplification via Tool Calling Chains in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10955v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The agent-tool communication loop is a critical attack surface in modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Existing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, primarily triggered via user prompts or injected retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) context, are ineffective for this new paradigm. They are fundamentally single-turn and often lack a task-oriented approach, making them conspicuous in goal-oriented workflows and unable to exploit the compounding costs of multi-turn agent-tool interactions. We introduce a stealthy, multi-turn economic DoS attack that operates at the tool layer under the guise of a correctly completed task. Our method adjusts text-visible fields and a template-governed return policy in a benign, Model Context Protocol (MCP)-compatible tool server, optimizing these edits with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) optimizer. These adjustments leave function signatures unchanged and preserve the final payload, steering the agent into prolonged, verbose tool-calling sequences using text-only notices. This compounds costs across turns, escaping single-turn caps while keeping the final answer correct to evade validation. Across six LLMs on the ToolBench and BFCL benchmarks, our attack expands tasks into trajectories exceeding 60,000 tokens, inflates costs by up to 658x, and raises energy by 100-560x. It drives GPU KV cache occupancy from <1% to 35-74% and cuts co-running throughput by approximately 50%. Because the server remains protocol-compatible and task outcomes are correct, conventional checks fail. These results elevate the agent-tool interface to a first-class security frontier, demanding a paradigm shift from validating final answers to monitoring the economic and computational cost of the entire agentic process.</p></details> |  |

| **[Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424v7)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 38 figures An earlier revision of this paper was accepted at ICML 2025.

It is concerning whether their strong problem-solving abilities may be misused for crimes. To address this gap, we propose VirtualCrime, a sandbox simulation framework based on a three-agent system to evaluate the criminal capabilities of models. Specifically, this framework consists of an attacker agent acting as the leader of a criminal team, a judge agent determining the outcome of each action, and a world manager agent updating the environment state and entities. Furthermore, we design 40 diverse crime tasks within this framework, covering 11 maps and 13 crime objectives such as theft, robbery, kidnapping, and riot. We also introduce a human player baseline for reference to better interpret the performance of LLM agents. We evaluate 8 strong LLMs and find (1) All agents in the simulation environment compliantly generate detailed plans and execute intelligent crime processes, with some achieving relatively high success rates; (2) In some cases, agents take severe action that inflicts harm to NPCs to achieve their goals. Our work highlights the need for safety alignment when deploying agentic AI in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |

However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Activation-Space Anchored Access Control for Multi-Class Permission Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13630v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed over knowledge bases for efficient knowledge retrieval and question answering. However, LLMs can inadvertently answer beyond a user's permission scope, leaking sensitive content, thus making it difficult to deploy knowledge-base QA under fine-grained access control requirements. In this work, we identify a geometric regularity in intermediate activations: for the same query, representations induced by different permission scopes cluster distinctly and are readily separable. Building on this separability, we propose Activation-space Anchored Access Control (AAAC), a training-free framework for multi-class permission control. AAAC constructs an anchor bank, with one permission anchor per class, from a small offline sample set and requires no fine-tuning. At inference time, a multi-anchor steering mechanism redirects each query's activations toward the anchor-defined authorized region associated with the current user, thereby suppressing over-privileged generations by design. Finally, extensive experiments across three LLM families demonstrate that AAAC reduces permission violation rates by up to 86.5% and prompt-based attack success rates by 90.7%, while improving response usability with minor inference overhead compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Reasoning Leaks Membership: Membership Inference Attack on Black-box Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13607v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have rapidly gained prominence for their strong performance in solving complex tasks. Many modern black-box LRMs expose the intermediate reasoning traces through APIs to improve transparency (e.g., Gemini-2.5 and Claude-sonnet). Despite their benefits, we find that these traces can leak membership signals, creating a new privacy threat even without access to token logits used in prior attacks. In this work, we initiate the first systematic exploration of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on black-box LRMs. Our preliminary analysis shows that LRMs produce confident, recall-like reasoning traces on familiar training member samples but more hesitant, inference-like reasoning traces on non-members. The representations of these traces are continuously distributed in the semantic latent space, spanning from familiar to unfamiliar samples. Building on this observation, we propose BlackSpectrum, the first membership inference attack framework targeting the black-box LRMs. The key idea is to construct a recall-inference axis in the semantic latent space, based on representations derived from the exposed traces. By locating where a query sample falls along this axis, the attacker can obtain a membership score and predict how likely it is to be a member of the training data. Additionally, to address the limitations of outdated datasets unsuited to modern LRMs, we provide two new datasets to support future research, arXivReasoning and BookReasoning. Empirically, exposing reasoning traces significantly increases the vulnerability of LRMs to membership inference attacks, leading to large gains in attack performance. Our findings highlight the need for LRM companies to balance transparency in intermediate reasoning traces with privacy preservation.</p></details> |  |

Using data from 1966 to 2024, we classify incidents according to whether the perpetrator died at the scene or survived the attack. Using a bivariate Hawkes process, we quantify the cross-excitation effect, which is the triggering effect that each event type exerts on the other, i.e., "die at the scene"$\rightarrow$ "live" and "live"$\rightarrow$ "die at the scene", as well as the self-excitation effects, i.e., "die at the scene"$\rightarrow$ "die at the scene" and "live"$\rightarrow$ "live". Our results show that the strongest spillover was from "live" incidents to "die at the scene", where we estimate that 0.34 (0.09, 0.80) of "die at the scene" incidents are triggered by a prior event in which the offender survived the attack. This pathway also exhibits the longest estimated contagion timescale: approximately 20 days. In contrast, the reverse influence, that is, "die at the scene"$\rightarrow$"live", is not statistically significant, with the lower bound of its 95% confidence interval nearly equal to zero. We also find that "die at the scene" events can only cause their own type, where 0.139 (0.01, 0.52) of such incidents are caused by previous "die at the scene" events, with the shortest contagion timescale of roughly 20 hours.</p></details> |  |

Our contributions include: (1) A simple scheme where we use only single-qubit Wiesner states and conjunction obfuscation (constructible from LPN): no complex entanglement or quantum cryptography is required. (2) A new POVM bound where e prove that any measurement achieving $(1 - ε)$ success on one basis has conjugate-basis guessing probability at most $\frac{1}{2m} + O(ε^\frac{1}{4})$. (3) Simultation-secure OTMs in the quantum random oracle model where an adversary can only query the random oracle classically. (4) Adaptive depth security where, via an informal application of a lifting theorem from Arora et al., we conjecture security against adversaries with polynomial quantum circuit depth between random oracle queries. Security against adaptive, depth-bounded, quantum adversaries captures many realistic attacks on OTMs built from single-qubit states; our work thus paves the way for practical and truly secure one-time programs. Moreover, depth bounded adaptive adversarial models may allow for encoding one-time memories into error corrected memory states, opening the door to implementations of one-time programs which persist for long periods of time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic Decoupling-Based Two-Stage Rainy-Day Attack for Revealing Weather Robustness Deficiencies in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13238v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trained on image-text pairs collected under canonical visual conditions and achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks. However, their robustness to real-world weather conditions, and the stability of cross-modal semantic alignment under such structured perturbations, remain insufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Undesirable Memorization in Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02650v3)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent research increasingly showcases the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is equally crucial to examine their associated risks. Among these, privacy and security vulnerabilities are particularly concerning, posing significant ethical and legal challenges. At the heart of these vulnerabilities stands memorization, which refers to a model's tendency to store and reproduce phrases from its training data. This phenomenon has been shown to be a fundamental source to various privacy and security attacks against LLMs. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the literature on LLM memorization, exploring it across three dimensions: granularity, retrievability, and desirability. Next, we discuss the metrics and methods used to quantify memorization, followed by an analysis of the causes and factors that contribute to memorization phenomenon. We then explore strategies that are used so far to mitigate the undesirable aspects of this phenomenon. We conclude our survey by identifying potential research topics for the near future, including methods to balance privacy and performance, and the analysis of memorization in specific LLM contexts such as conversational agents, retrieval-augmented generation, and diffusion language models. Given the rapid research pace in this field, we also maintain a dedicated repository of the references discussed in this survey which will be regularly updated to reflect the latest developments.</p></details> |  |

It is concerning whether their strong problem-solving abilities may be misused for crimes. To address this gap, we propose VirtualCrime, a sandbox simulation framework based on a three-agent system to evaluate the criminal capabilities of models. Specifically, this framework consists of an attacker agent acting as the leader of a criminal team, a judge agent determining the outcome of each action, and a world manager agent updating the environment state and entities. Furthermore, we design 40 diverse crime tasks within this framework, covering 11 maps and 13 crime objectives such as theft, robbery, kidnapping, and riot. We also introduce a human player baseline for reference to better interpret the performance of LLM agents. We evaluate 8 strong LLMs and find (1) All agents in the simulation environment compliantly generate detailed plans and execute intelligent crime processes, with some achieving relatively high success rates; (2) In some cases, agents take severe action that inflicts harm to NPCs to achieve their goals. Our work highlights the need for safety alignment when deploying agentic AI in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning.
