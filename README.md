| **[How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today to superintelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures. In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk.</p></details> |  |

However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

| **[Are You Getting What You Pay For? Auditing Model Substitution in LLM APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04715v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via black-box APIs introduces a significant trust challenge: users pay for services based on advertised model capabilities (e.g., size, performance), but providers may covertly substitute the specified model with a cheaper, lower-quality alternative to reduce operational costs. This lack of transparency undermines fairness, erodes trust, and complicates reliable benchmarking. Detecting such substitutions is difficult due to the black-box nature, typically limiting interaction to input-output queries. This paper formalizes the problem of model substitution detection in LLM APIs. We systematically evaluate existing verification techniques, including output-based statistical tests, benchmark evaluations, and log probability analysis, under various realistic attack scenarios like model quantization, randomized substitution, and benchmark evasion. Our findings reveal the limitations of methods relying solely on text outputs, especially against subtle or adaptive attacks. While log probability analysis offers stronger guarantees when available, its accessibility is often limited. We conclude by discussing the potential of hardware-based solutions like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a pathway towards provable model integrity, highlighting the trade-offs between security, performance, and provider adoption.

| **[CyberLLMInstruct: A New Dataset for Analysing Safety of Fine-Tuned LLMs Using Cyber Security Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09334v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of new malware. To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. The dataset creation pipeline, along with comprehensive documentation, examples, and resources for reproducing our results, is publicly available at https://github.com/Adelsamir01/CyberLLMInstruct.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttackLLM: LLM-based Attack Pattern Generation for an Industrial Control System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04187v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious examples are crucial for evaluating the robustness of machine learning algorithms under attack, particularly in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, collecting normal and attack data in ICS environments is challenging due to the scarcity of testbeds and the high cost of human expertise. Existing datasets are often limited by the domain expertise of practitioners, making the process costly and inefficient. The lack of comprehensive attack pattern data poses a significant problem for developing robust anomaly detection methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines data-centric and design-centric methodologies to generate attack patterns using large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate that the attack patterns generated by LLMs not only surpass the quality and quantity of those created by human experts but also offer a scalable solution that does not rely on expensive testbeds or pre-existing attack examples. This multi-agent based approach presents a promising avenue for enhancing the security and resilience of ICS environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Prompt Injection Attacks to LLMs via Poisoning Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14827v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a prompt injection attack, an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an LLM follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task. Existing attacks primarily focus on how to blend the injected prompt into the original prompt without altering the LLM itself. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we show that an attacker can boost the success of prompt injection attacks by poisoning the LLM's alignment process. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method to strategically create poisoned alignment samples. When even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned using our method, the aligned LLM becomes more vulnerable to prompt injection while maintaining its foundational capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/PoisonedAlign</p></details> |  |
| **[Les Dissonances: Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting in Multi-Tool Empowered LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03111v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are autonomous systems powered by LLMs, capable of reasoning and planning to solve problems by leveraging a set of tools. However, the integration of multi-tool capabilities in LLM agents introduces challenges in securely managing tools, ensuring their compatibility, handling dependency relationships, and protecting control flows within LLM agent workflows. In this paper, we present the first systematic security analysis of task control flows in multi-tool-enabled LLM agents. We identify a novel threat, Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting (XTHP), which includes multiple attack vectors to first hijack the normal control flows of agent tasks, and then collect and pollute confidential or private information within LLM agent systems. To understand the impact of this threat, we developed Chord, a dynamic scanning tool designed to automatically detect real-world agent tools susceptible to XTHP attacks. Our evaluation of 73 real-world tools from the repositories of two major LLM agent development frameworks, LangChain and LlamaIndex, revealed a significant security concern: 80% of the tools are vulnerable to hijacking attacks, 78% to XTH attacks, and 41% to XTP attacks, highlighting the prevalence of this threat.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROMPTFUZZ: Harnessing Fuzzing Techniques for Robust Testing of Prompt Injection in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14729v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread use in various applications due to their powerful capability to generate human-like text. However, prompt injection attacks, which involve overwriting a model's original instructions with malicious prompts to manipulate the generated text, have raised significant concerns about the security and reliability of LLMs. Ensuring that LLMs are robust against such attacks is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications, particularly in critical tasks. In this paper, we propose PROMPTFUZZ, a novel testing framework that leverages fuzzing techniques to systematically assess the robustness of LLMs against prompt injection attacks. Inspired by software fuzzing, PROMPTFUZZ selects promising seed prompts and generates a diverse set of prompt injections to evaluate the target LLM's resilience. PROMPTFUZZ operates in two stages: the prepare phase, which involves selecting promising initial seeds and collecting few-shot examples, and the focus phase, which uses the collected examples to generate diverse, high-quality prompt injections. Using PROMPTFUZZ, we can uncover more vulnerabilities in LLMs, even those with strong defense prompts. By deploying the generated attack prompts from PROMPTFUZZ in a real-world competition, we achieved the 7th ranking out of over 4000 participants (top 0.14%) within 2 hours. Additionally, we construct a dataset to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced robustness against prompt injection attacks. While the fine-tuned model shows improved robustness, PROMPTFUZZ continues to identify vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of robust testing for LLMs. Our work emphasizes the critical need for effective testing tools and provides a practical framework for evaluating and improving the robustness of LLMs against prompt injection attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Purifier for Robust LLM-Empowered Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02458v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems have revolutionized personalized recommendation frameworks and attracted extensive attention. Despite the remarkable success, existing LLM-empowered RecSys have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to minor perturbations. To mitigate the negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to employ collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the malicious collaborative knowledge from the user's historical interactions inserted by attackers. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand insufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework (RETURN) by retrieving external collaborative signals to purify the poisoned user profiles and enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered RecSys in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, retrieval-augmented perturbation positioning is proposed to identify potential perturbations within the users' historical sequences by retrieving external knowledge from collaborative item graphs. After that, we further retrieve the collaborative knowledge to cleanse the perturbations by using either deletion or replacement strategies and introduce a robust ensemble recommendation strategy to generate final robust predictions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETURN.</p></details> |  |

A key prerequisite to developing these safeguards is understanding the ability of these AI assistants to mislead human teammates. We investigate this attack problem within the context of an intellective strategy game where a team of three humans and one AI assistant collaborate to answer a series of trivia questions. Unbeknownst to the humans, the AI assistant is adversarial. Leveraging techniques from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), the AI assistant learns a model of the humans' trust evolution and uses that model to manipulate the group decision-making process to harm the team. We evaluate two models -- one inspired by literature and the other data-driven -- and find that both can effectively harm the human team. Moreover, we find that in this setting our data-driven model is capable of accurately predicting how human agents appraise their teammates given limited information on prior interactions. Finally, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLM models to human agents on our influence allocation task to evaluate whether the LLMs allocate influence similarly to humans or if they are more robust to our attack. These results enhance our understanding of decision-making dynamics in small human-AI teams and lay the foundation for defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Human-AI Coevolution</p></details> |

While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose DiffPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using DiffPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning-based Wildfire Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20006v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapidly growing wildfires have recently devastated societal assets, exposing a critical need for early warning systems to expedite relief efforts. Smoke detection using camera-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offers a promising solution for wildfire prediction. However, the rarity of smoke across time and space limits training data, raising model overfitting and bias concerns. Current DNNs, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, complicate robustness evaluation due to architectural differences. To address these challenges, we introduce WARP (Wildfire Adversarial Robustness Procedure), the first model-agnostic framework for evaluating wildfire detection models' adversarial robustness. WARP addresses inherent limitations in data diversity by generating adversarial examples through image-global and -local perturbations. Global and local attacks superimpose Gaussian noise and PNG patches onto image inputs, respectively; this suits both CNNs and transformers while generating realistic adversarial scenarios. Using WARP, we assessed real-time CNNs and Transformers, uncovering key vulnerabilities. At times, transformers exhibited over 70% precision degradation under global attacks, while both models generally struggled to differentiate cloud-like PNG patches from real smoke during local attacks. To enhance model robustness, we proposed four wildfire-oriented data augmentation techniques based on WARP's methodology and results, which diversify smoke image data and improve model precision and robustness. These advancements represent a substantial step toward developing a reliable early wildfire warning system, which may be our first safeguard against wildfire destruction.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language processing capabilities, they also face several challenges, including consistency issues, hallucinations, and jailbreak vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking refers to the crafting of prompts that bypass alignment safeguards, leading to unsafe outputs that compromise the integrity of LLMs. This work specifically focuses on the challenge of jailbreak vulnerabilities and introduces a novel taxonomy of jailbreak attacks grounded in the training domains of LLMs. It characterizes alignment failures through generalization, objectives, and robustness gaps. Our primary contribution is a perspective on jailbreak, framed through the different linguistic domains that emerge during LLM training and alignment. This viewpoint highlights the limitations of existing approaches and enables us to classify jailbreak attacks on the basis of the underlying model deficiencies they exploit. Unlike conventional classifications that categorize attacks based on prompt construction methods (e.g., prompt templating), our approach provides a deeper understanding of LLM behavior. We introduce a taxonomy with four categories -- mismatched generalization, competing objectives, adversarial robustness, and mixed attacks -- offering insights into the fundamental nature of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Finally, we present key lessons derived from this taxonomic study.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

Recently, some works have utilized adversarial attacks to protect copyright. However, all these works focus on single-image generation tasks which only need to consider the inner feature of images. Previous methods are inefficient in attacking MVDMs because they lack the consideration of disrupting the geometric and visual consistency among the generated multi-view images. This paper is the first to address the intellectual property infringement issue arising from MVDMs. Accordingly, we propose a novel latent feature and attention dual erasure attack to disrupt the distribution of latent feature and the consistency across the generated images from multi-view and multi-domain simultaneously. The experiments conducted on SOTA MVDMs indicate that our approach achieves superior performances in terms of attack effectiveness, transferability, and robustness against defense methods. Therefore, this paper provides an efficient solution to protect 3D assets from MVDMs-based 3D geometry reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods.

To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers.

To address this issue, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and matrix factorization have been proposed; however, these compressed models are often highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We introduce the \textbf{Efficient Ensemble Defense (EED)} technique, which diversifies the compression of a single base model based on different pruning importance scores and enhances ensemble diversity to achieve high adversarial robustness and resource efficiency. EED dynamically determines the number of necessary sub-models during the inference stage, minimizing unnecessary computations while maintaining high robustness. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, EED demonstrated state-of-the-art robustness performance compared to existing adversarial pruning techniques, along with an inference speed improvement of up to 1.86 times.

However, these models face significant robustness challenges in real-world scenarios due to natural noise and adversarial perturbations, and their robustness remains underexplored. In this study, we systematically evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art GUI grounding models, such as UGround, under three conditions: natural noise, untargeted adversarial attacks, and targeted adversarial attacks. Our experiments, which were conducted across a wide range of GUI environments, including mobile, desktop, and web interfaces, have clearly demonstrated that GUI grounding models exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to adversarial perturbations and low-resolution conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of GUI grounding models and establish a strong benchmark for future research aimed at enhancing their robustness in practical applications.

While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose DiffPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using DiffPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning-based Wildfire Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20006v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapidly growing wildfires have recently devastated societal assets, exposing a critical need for early warning systems to expedite relief efforts. Smoke detection using camera-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offers a promising solution for wildfire prediction. However, the rarity of smoke across time and space limits training data, raising model overfitting and bias concerns. Current DNNs, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, complicate robustness evaluation due to architectural differences. To address these challenges, we introduce WARP (Wildfire Adversarial Robustness Procedure), the first model-agnostic framework for evaluating wildfire detection models' adversarial robustness. WARP addresses inherent limitations in data diversity by generating adversarial examples through image-global and -local perturbations. Global and local attacks superimpose Gaussian noise and PNG patches onto image inputs, respectively; this suits both CNNs and transformers while generating realistic adversarial scenarios. Using WARP, we assessed real-time CNNs and Transformers, uncovering key vulnerabilities. At times, transformers exhibited over 70% precision degradation under global attacks, while both models generally struggled to differentiate cloud-like PNG patches from real smoke during local attacks. To enhance model robustness, we proposed four wildfire-oriented data augmentation techniques based on WARP's methodology and results, which diversify smoke image data and improve model precision and robustness. These advancements represent a substantial step toward developing a reliable early wildfire warning system, which may be our first safeguard against wildfire destruction.</p></details> |  |
