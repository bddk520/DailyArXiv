| **[A Multi-Agent LLM Defense Pipeline Against Prompt Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14285v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attacks represent a major vulnerability in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, where malicious instructions embedded in user inputs can override system prompts and induce unintended behaviors. This paper presents a novel multi-agent defense framework that employs specialized LLM agents in coordinated pipelines to detect and neutralize prompt injection attacks in real-time. We evaluate our approach using two distinct architectures: a sequential chain-of-agents pipeline and a hierarchical coordinator-based system. Our comprehensive evaluation on 55 unique prompt injection attacks, grouped into 8 categories and totaling 400 attack instances across two LLM platforms (ChatGLM and Llama2), demonstrates significant security improvements. Without defense mechanisms, baseline Attack Success Rates (ASR) reached 30% for ChatGLM and 20% for Llama2. Our multi-agent pipeline achieved 100% mitigation, reducing ASR to 0% across all tested scenarios. The framework demonstrates robustness across multiple attack categories including direct overrides, code execution attempts, data exfiltration, and obfuscation techniques, while maintaining system functionality for legitimate queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference standard paper</p></details> |
| **[LLM Watermark Evasion via Bias Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23019v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) embeds a statistical signal during generation to enable detection of model-produced text. While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[QGuard:Question-based Zero-shot Guard for Multi-modal LLM Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12299v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas. However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks. Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks associated with harmful prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACLW 2025 (WOAH); fix typo</p></details> |
| **[Dagger Behind Smile: Fool LLMs with a Happy Ending Story](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13115v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention from $\textit{jailbreak}$ attacks, where adversarial prompts crafted through optimization or manual design exploit LLMs to generate malicious contents. However, optimization-based attacks have limited efficiency and transferability, while existing manual designs are either easily detectable or demand intricate interactions with LLMs. In this paper, we first point out a novel perspective for jailbreak attacks: LLMs are more responsive to $\textit{positive}$ prompts. Based on this, we deploy Happy Ending Attack (HEA) to wrap up a malicious request in a scenario template involving a positive prompt formed mainly via a $\textit{happy ending}$, it thus fools LLMs into jailbreaking either immediately or at a follow-up malicious request. This has made HEA both efficient and effective, as it requires only up to two turns to fully jailbreak LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our HEA can successfully jailbreak on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro, and achieves 88.79% attack success rate on average. We also provide quantitative explanations for the success of HEA.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[STAC: When Innocent Tools Form Dangerous Chains to Jailbreak LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25624v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety is Not Only About Refusal: Reasoning-Enhanced Fine-tuning for Interpretable LLM Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05021v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit weaknesses in traditional safety alignment, which often relies on rigid refusal heuristics or representation engineering to block harmful outputs. While they are effective for direct adversarial attacks, they fall short of broader safety challenges requiring nuanced, context-aware decision-making. To address this, we propose Reasoning-enhanced Finetuning for interpretable LLM Safety (Rational), a novel framework that trains models to engage in explicit safe reasoning before response. Fine-tuned models leverage the extensive pretraining knowledge in self-generated reasoning to bootstrap their own safety through structured reasoning, internalizing context-sensitive decision-making. Our findings suggest that safety extends beyond refusal, requiring context awareness for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive responses. Reasoning is not only a core capability of LLMs but also a fundamental mechanism for LLM safety. Rational employs reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning, allowing it to reject harmful prompts while providing meaningful and context-aware responses in complex scenarios.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Watermark under Fire: A Robustness Evaluation of LLM Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13425v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various watermarking methods (``watermarkers'') have been proposed to identify LLM-generated texts; yet, due to the lack of unified evaluation platforms, many critical questions remain under-explored: i) What are the strengths/limitations of various watermarkers, especially their attack robustness? ii) How do various design choices impact their robustness? iii) How to optimally operate watermarkers in adversarial environments? To fill this gap, we systematize existing LLM watermarkers and watermark removal attacks, mapping out their design spaces. We then develop WaterPark, a unified platform that integrates 10 state-of-the-art watermarkers and 12 representative attacks. More importantly, by leveraging WaterPark, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of existing watermarkers, unveiling the impact of various design choices on their attack robustness. We further explore the best practices to operate watermarkers in adversarial environments. We believe our study sheds light on current LLM watermarking techniques while WaterPark serves as a valuable testbed to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages.

| **[SemanticShield: LLM-Powered Audits Expose Shilling Attacks in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24961v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks, where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore, we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at https://github.com/FrankenstLee/SemanticShield.</p></details> |  |
| **[HarmMetric Eval: Benchmarking Metrics and Judges for LLM Harmfulness Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24384v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval, and the code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HarmMetric-Eval-4CBE.</p></details> |  |

However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

AI-based detection methods can help mitigate these risks; however, the performance of such models is inherently dependent on the quality and diversity of their training data. Presently, the available datasets are heavily skewed towards English and Chinese audio, which limits the global applicability of these anti-spoofing systems. To address this limitation, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset (MLAAD), version 8, created using 119 TTS models, comprising 58 different architectures, to generate 570.3 hours of synthetic voice in 40 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD and observe that it demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild and Fake-Or-Real when used as a training resource. Moreover, compared to the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, each excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD and making a trained model accessible via an interactive webserver, we aim to democratize anti-spoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of specialists, and contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and deepfakes.</p></details> | IJCNN 2024 |
| **[EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

It is particularly useful in chatbot applications, allowing developers to customize LLM output without expensive retraining. Despite their significant utility in various applications, RAG systems present new security risks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that allows an adversary to inject a single malicious document into a RAG system's knowledge base, and mount a backdoor poisoning attack. We design Phantom, a general two-stage optimization framework against RAG systems, that crafts a malicious poisoned document leading to an integrity violation in the model's output. First, the document is constructed to be retrieved only when a specific naturally occurring trigger sequence of tokens appears in the victim's queries. Second, the document is further optimized with crafted adversarial text that induces various adversarial objectives on the LLM output, including refusal to answer, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors.We demonstrate our attacks on multiple open-source LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama, and show that they transfer to closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Finally, we successfully demonstrate our attack on an end-to-end black-box production RAG system: NVIDIA's "Chat with RTX''.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairness Testing in Retrieval-Augmented Generation: How Small Perturbations Reveal Bias in Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26584v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace (Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B), each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs without compromising fairness or reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figure |

However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing among multiple data owners, and proprietary restrictions prevent the learning service provider (LSP) from sharing the FM. In this work, we propose BlindFed, a framework enabling collaborative FM adaptation while protecting both parties: data owners do not access the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see sensitive task data. BlindFed relies on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and consists of three key innovations: (i) FHE-friendly architectural modifications via polynomial approximations and low-rank adapters, (ii) a two-stage split learning approach combining offline knowledge distillation and online encrypted inference for adapter training without backpropagation through the FM, and (iii) a privacy-boosting scheme using sample permutations and stochastic block sampling to mitigate model extraction attacks. Empirical results on four image classification datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the BlindFed framework, albeit at a high communication cost and large computational complexity for the LSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Leaky Thoughts: Large Reasoning Models Are Not Private Thinkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15674v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[MLAAD: The Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09512v8)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology offers notable benefits, such as providing a voice for individuals with speech impairments, but it also facilitates the creation of audio deepfakes and spoofing attacks. AI-based detection methods can help mitigate these risks; however, the performance of such models is inherently dependent on the quality and diversity of their training data. Presently, the available datasets are heavily skewed towards English and Chinese audio, which limits the global applicability of these anti-spoofing systems. To address this limitation, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset (MLAAD), version 8, created using 119 TTS models, comprising 58 different architectures, to generate 570.3 hours of synthetic voice in 40 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD and observe that it demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild and Fake-Or-Real when used as a training resource. Moreover, compared to the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, each excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD and making a trained model accessible via an interactive webserver, we aim to democratize anti-spoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of specialists, and contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and deepfakes.</p></details> | IJCNN 2024 |
| **[EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
