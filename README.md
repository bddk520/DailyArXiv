Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%.</p></details> |  |
| **[GateBreaker: Gate-Guided Attacks on Mixture-of-Expert LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21008v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost. As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs. However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined. The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness. In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment. Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing. Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation. These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack. Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'26</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Driven Feature-Level Adversarial Attacks on Android Malware Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21404v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth in both the scale and complexity of Android malware has driven the widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques for scalable and accurate malware detection. Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that introduce carefully crafted feature-level perturbations to evade detection while preserving malicious functionality. In this paper, we present LAMLAD, a novel adversarial attack framework that exploits the generative and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to bypass ML-based Android malware classifiers. LAMLAD employs a dual-agent architecture composed of an LLM manipulator, which generates realistic and functionality-preserving feature perturbations, and an LLM analyzer, which guides the perturbation process toward successful evasion. To improve efficiency and contextual awareness, LAMLAD integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into the LLM pipeline. Focusing on Drebin-style feature representations, LAMLAD enables stealthy and high-confidence attacks against widely deployed Android malware detection systems. We evaluate LAMLAD against three representative ML-based Android malware detectors and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMLAD achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of up to 97%, requiring on average only three attempts per adversarial sample, highlighting its effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability in practical adversarial settings. Furthermore, we propose an adversarial training-based defense strategy that reduces the ASR by more than 30% on average, significantly enhancing model robustness against LAMLAD-style attacks.</p></details> |  |

Although CoT-enhanced LLM vulnerability detectors are believed to provide improved robustness against obfuscated malicious code, we find that their reasoning chains and semantic abstraction processes exhibit exploitable systematic weaknesses.This allows attackers to covertly embed malicious logic, bypass code review, and propagate backdoored components throughout real-world software supply chains.To investigate this issue, we present CoTDeceptor, the first adversarial code obfuscation framework targeting CoT-enhanced LLM detectors. CoTDeceptor autonomously constructs evolving, hard-to-reverse multi-stage obfuscation strategy chains that effectively disrupt CoT-driven detection logic.We obtained malicious code provided by security enterprise, experimental results demonstrate that CoTDeceptor achieves stable and transferable evasion performance against state-of-the-art LLMs and vulnerability detection agents. CoTDeceptor bypasses 14 out of 15 vulnerability categories, compared to only 2 bypassed by prior methods. Our findings highlight potential risks in real-world software supply chains and underscore the need for more robust and interpretable LLM-powered security analysis systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Casting a SPELL: Sentence Pairing Exploration for LLM Limitation-breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21236v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.</p></details> | Accepted to FSE 2026 |
| **[AegisAgent: An Autonomous Defense Agent Against Prompt Injection Attacks in LLM-HARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20986v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into wearable sensing is creating a new class of mobile applications capable of nuanced human activity understanding. However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation. Our work makes the first step towards building secure and trustworthy LLM-driven HAR systems.</p></details> |  |

Their widespread use has sparked concerns, especially through jailbreak attacks that bypass safety measures to produce harmful content. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of large language models (LLMs), addressing critical research questions on the evolution and determinants of model safety. Specifically, we begin by identifying the most effective techniques for detecting jailbreak attacks. Next, we investigate whether newer versions of LLMs offer improved security compared to their predecessors. We also assess the impact of model size on overall security and explore the potential benefits of integrating multiple defense strategies to enhance the security. Our study evaluates both open-source (e.g., LLaMA and Mistral) and closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4) by employing four state-of-the-art attack techniques and assessing the efficacy of three new defensive approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Odysseus: Jailbreaking Commercial Multimodal LLM-integrated Systems via Dual Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20168v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By integrating language understanding with perceptual modalities such as images, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) constitute a critical substrate for modern AI systems, particularly intelligent agents operating in open and interactive environments. However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2026</p></details> |

However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs. To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs, 2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few Tokens Matter: Entropy Guided Attacks on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21815v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages,11 figures,8 tables</p></details> |

While existing research mainly targets RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging studies highlight critical security concerns. Yet, current adversarial approaches remain limited, mostly addressing white-box scenarios or heuristic black-box attacks without fully investigating vulnerabilities in the retrieval phase. Additionally, prior works mainly focus on factoid Q&A tasks, their attacks lack complexity and can be easily corrected by advanced LLMs. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic and critical threat scenario: adversarial attacks intended for opinion manipulation against black-box RAG models, particularly on controversial topics. Specifically, we propose FlippedRAG, a transfer-based adversarial attack against black-box RAG systems. We first demonstrate that the underlying retriever of a black-box RAG system can be reverse-engineered, enabling us to train a surrogate retriever. Leveraging the surrogate retriever, we further craft target poisoning triggers, altering vary few documents to effectively manipulate both retrieval and subsequent generation. Extensive empirical results show that FlippedRAG substantially outperforms baseline methods, improving the average attack success rate by 16.7%. FlippedRAG achieves on average a 50% directional shift in the opinion polarity of RAG-generated responses, ultimately causing a notable 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of several potential defensive measures, concluding that existing mitigation strategies remain insufficient against such sophisticated manipulation attacks.

Privacy regulations, however, forbid retaining past data, necessitating rehearsal-free IL (RF-IL). Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, with their prompt-tunable cross-modal representations, enable efficient adaptation to new spoofing styles and domains. Capitalizing on this strength, we propose \textbf{SVLP-IL}, a VLP-based RF-IL framework that balances stability and plasticity via \textit{Multi-Aspect Prompting} (MAP) and \textit{Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation} (SEWC). MAP isolates domain dependencies, enhances distribution-shift sensitivity, and mitigates forgetting by jointly exploiting universal and domain-specific cues. SEWC selectively preserves critical weights from previous tasks, retaining essential knowledge while allowing flexibility for new adaptations. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAD benchmarks show that SVLP-IL significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting and enhances performance on unseen domains. SVLP-IL offers a privacy-compliant, practical solution for robust lifelong PAD deployment in RF-IL settings.</p></details> |  |

Traditional defense mechanisms, which operate on static rules or shallow content filters, struggle to identify these conversational threats, especially when attackers use multimedia obfuscation and context-aware dialogue. In this work, we ask a provocative question inspired by the classic Imitation Game: Can machines convincingly pose as human victims to turn deception against cybercriminals? We present LURE (LLM-based User Response Engagement), the first system to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) as active agents, not as passive classifiers, embedded within adversarial chat environments. LURE combines automated discovery, adversarial interaction, and OCR-based analysis of image-embedded payment data. Applied to the setting of illicit video chat scams on Telegram, our system engaged 53 actors across 98 groups. In over 56 percent of interactions, the LLM maintained multi-round conversations without being noticed as a bot, effectively "winning" the imitation game. Our findings reveal key behavioral patterns in scam operations, such as payment flows, upselling strategies, and platform migration tactics.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning these pre-trained models for personalization raises concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To address this issue, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has recently been proposed, which embeds watermarks into fine-tuning datasets via backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain dormant on benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite its promise, the robustness of DOV against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how adversaries can circumvent these mechanisms, enabling models trained on watermarked datasets to bypass ownership verification. We begin by analyzing the limitations of potential attacks achieved by backdoor removal, including TPD and T2IShield. In practice, TPD suffers from inconsistent effectiveness due to randomness, while T2IShield fails when watermarks are embedded as local image patches. To this end, we introduce CEAT2I, the first CEA specifically targeting DOV in T2I diffusion models. CEAT2I consists of three stages: (1) motivated by the observation that T2I models converge faster on watermarked samples with respect to intermediate features rather than training loss, we reliably detect watermarked samples; (2) we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected samples and monitor feature shifts to identify trigger tokens; and (3) we apply a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEAT2I effectively evades state-of-the-art DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance.

Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</p></details> |  |

To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack (SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across the entire model lifecycle.</p></details> |  |

Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.</p></details> |  |

Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets.
