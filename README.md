| **[Cascade: Token-Sharded Private LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05228v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ICML 2025 Main Proceedings as "Hidden No More: Attacking and Defending Private Third-Party LLM Inference", together with arXiv:2505.18332</p></details> |

Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety.

| **[Tail-aware Adversarial Attacks: A Distributional Approach to Efficient LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04446v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions. Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Slipping: A Mechanistic Understanding of Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04365v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat. However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks: Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning. Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening, a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2) show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</p></details> | 4 figures |
| **[Blackbox Dataset Inference for LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03619v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the training of large language models (LLMs) can involve personally identifiable information and copyrighted material, incurring dataset misuse. To mitigate the problem of dataset misuse, this paper explores \textit{dataset inference}, which aims to detect if a suspect model $\mathcal{M}$ used a victim dataset $\mathcal{D}$ in training. Previous research tackles dataset inference by aggregating results of membership inference attacks (MIAs) -- methods to determine whether individual samples are a part of the training dataset. However, restricted by the low accuracy of MIAs, previous research mandates grey-box access to $\mathcal{M}$ to get intermediate outputs (probabilities, loss, perplexity, etc.) for obtaining satisfactory results. This leads to reduced practicality, as LLMs, especially those deployed for profits, have limited incentives to return the intermediate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new method of dataset inference with only black-box access to the target model (i.e., assuming only the text-based responses of the target model are available). Our method is enabled by two sets of locally built reference models, one set involving $\mathcal{D}$ in training and the other not. By measuring which set of reference model $\mathcal{M}$ is closer to, we determine if $\mathcal{M}$ used $\mathcal{D}$ for training. Evaluations of real-world LLMs in the wild show that our method offers high accuracy in all settings and presents robustness against bypassing attempts.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIAR: Leveraging Inference Time Alignment (Best-of-N) to Jailbreak LLMs in Seconds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05232v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks expose vulnerabilities in safety-aligned LLMs by eliciting harmful outputs through carefully crafted prompts. Existing methods rely on discrete optimization or trained adversarial generators, but are slow, compute-intensive, and often impractical. We argue that these inefficiencies stem from a mischaracterization of the problem. Instead, we frame jailbreaks as inference-time misalignment and introduce LIAR (Leveraging Inference-time misAlignment to jailbReak), a fast, black-box, best-of-$N$ sampling attack requiring no training. LIAR matches state-of-the-art success rates while reducing perplexity by $10\times$ and Time-to-Attack from hours to seconds. We also introduce a theoretical "safety net against jailbreaks" metric to quantify safety alignment strength and derive suboptimality bounds. Our work offers a simple yet effective tool for evaluating LLM robustness and advancing alignment research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta SecAlign: A Secure Foundation LLM Against Prompt Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02735v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7 security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks, including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Control at Stake: Evaluating the Security Landscape of LLM-Driven Email Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02699v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of LLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources to support complex task execution. Among these, LLM email agent apps represent one of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication medium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to email using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions via external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing deployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains underexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential security risk within these agent apps and their broader implications. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of LLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which overrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources, allowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further perform specific attack scenarios without user awareness. To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to evaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an empirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps, 12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world email agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all 1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack attempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some LLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops to as few as 1.23.</p></details> |  |

This accessibility extends to malicious software development, raising significant security concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability: malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the attack success rate while preserving model capabilities.

Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic, and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities. To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors. The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection, demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of multi-agent safety.

| **[Trojan Horse Prompting: Jailbreaking Conversational Multimodal Models by Forging Assistant Message](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04673v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational context integrity.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates model inversion attacks on the Llama 3.2 model, a multilingual LLM developed by Meta. By querying the model with carefully crafted prompts, we demonstrate the extraction of personally identifiable information (PII) such as passwords, email addresses, and account numbers. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of even smaller LLMs to privacy attacks and underscore the need for robust defenses. We discuss potential mitigation strategies, including differential privacy and data sanitization, and call for further research into privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arbiter PUF: Uniqueness and Reliability Analysis Using Hybrid CMOS-Stanford Memristor Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04461v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an increasingly interconnected world, protecting electronic devices has grown more crucial because of the dangers of data extraction, reverse engineering, and hardware tampering. Producing chips in a third-party manufacturing company can let hackers change the design. As the Internet of Things (IoT) proliferates, physical attacks happen more, and conventional cryptography techniques do not function well. In this paper, we investigate the design and assessment of PUFs using the Stanford Memristor Model, utilizing its random filament evolution to improve security. The system was built using 45nm CMOS technology. A comparison is made between CMOS-based and memristor-based Arbiter PUFs, evaluating their performance under temperature, voltage, and process variations. Intra- and inter-hamming distances are employed by Monte Carlo simulations to estimate uniqueness and reliability. The results show that memristor-based PUFs offer better reliability than CMOS-based designs, though uniqueness needs further improvement. Furthermore, this study sheds light on the reasonableness of memristor-based PUFs for secure applications in hardware security.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional analysis methods, including manual inspection and automated tools, struggle with increasingly expanding cellular network specifications. This paper investigates the feasibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated cellular network specification refinement. To advance it, we leverage 200,000+ approved 3GPP Change Requests (CRs) that document specification revisions, constructing a valuable dataset for domain tasks. We introduce CR-eval, a principled evaluation framework, and benchmark 16 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating that top models can discover security-related weaknesses in over 127 out of 200 test cases within five trials. To bridge potential gaps, we explore LLM specialization techniques, including fine-tuning an 8B model to match or surpass advanced LLMs like GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1. Evaluations on 30 cellular attacks identify open challenges for achieving full automation. These findings confirm that LLMs can automate the refinement of cellular network specifications and provide valuable insights to guide future research in this direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdooring Bias ($B^2$) into Stable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15213v4)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large text-conditional diffusion models have revolutionized image generation by enabling users to create realistic, high-quality images from textual prompts, significantly enhancing artistic creation and visual communication. However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier (\$10-\$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to USENIX Security '25</p></details> |

Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which process diverse data types and enable interaction through various channels, have expanded beyond the text-to-text limitations of early LLMs, attracting significant and concurrent attention from both researchers and industry. While LLMs and LMMs are starting to spread widely, concerns about their privacy risks are increasing as well. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are techniques used to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model's training set, which is a key metric for assessing the privacy vulnerabilities of machine learning models. Hu et al. show that various machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to MIA. Despite extensive studies on MIAs in classic models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and limitations in advanced large-scale models like LLMs and LMMs. In this paper, we systematically reviewed recent studies of MIA against LLMs and LMMs. We analyzed and categorized each attack based on its methodology, scenario, and targeted model, and we discussed the limitations of existing research. In addition to examining attacks on pre-training and fine-tuning stages, we also explore MIAs that target other development pipelines, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the model alignment process. Based on the survey, we provide suggestions for future studies to improve the robustness of MIA in large-scale AI models.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Bit Model Aggregation for Differentially Private and Byzantine-Robust Personalized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03973v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the scale of federated learning (FL) systems expands, their inherent performance limitations like communication overhead, Byzantine vulnerability, and privacy leakage have become increasingly critical. This paper considers a personalized FL framework based on model regularization, and proposes a model aggregation algorithm named PRoBit+ to concurrently overcome these limitations. PRoBit+ employs one-bit stochastic quantization and maximum likelihood estimation for parameter aggregation, and dynamically adjusts the step size of parameter updates, improving training stability of deep neural networks under low communication overhead and heterogeneous data distributions. PRoBit+'s statistical analysis is then conducted and its Byzantine robustness is proved. The $(\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy and a convergence upper bound of the PRoBit+ based FL are also theoretically established in heterogeneous contexts. The analysis illustrates the trade-off among transmission accuracy, security guarantees, and convergence rates, and also indicates that the performance degradation caused by transmission errors and privacy protection can be progressively eliminated at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/M)$ as the number of uploading clients $M$ increases. Comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted to assess PRoBit+ in comparison to benchmark methods across different Byzantine attacks and varying proportions of malicious clients. The experimental results demonstrate that PRoBit+ exhibits improved Byzantine robustness over existing bit-based transmission schemes, minimal performance degradation related to privacy protection, and nearly identical performance to full-precision FedAvg in a secure environment.</p></details> |  |

We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the attack success rate while preserving model capabilities.

In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability. We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
