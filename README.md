| **[Proactive defense against LLM Jailbreak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05052v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of powerful large language models (LLMs) has necessitated robust safety alignment, yet these models remain vulnerable to evolving adversarial attacks, including multi-turn jailbreaks that iteratively search for successful queries. Current defenses, primarily reactive and static, often fail to counter these search-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct, a novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead autonomous jailbreaking processes. Our core idea is to intentionally provide adversaries with "spurious responses" that appear to be results of successful jailbreak attacks but contain no actual harmful content. These misleading responses provide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the adversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the jailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, jailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and significantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\%. When combined with other defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest attack strategies to 0\%. ProAct represents an orthogonal defense strategy that can serve as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most effective jailbreaking attacks.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as 97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts, and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA, and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/psyonp/SocialHarmBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL Is a Hammer and LLMs Are Nails: A Simple Reinforcement Learning Recipe for Strong Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04885v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection poses a serious threat to the reliability and safety of LLM agents. Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy and SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to more thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably necessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end, we introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that automatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via reinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained entirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models with defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly effective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR against GPT-4o and a $72\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy defense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in attacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity objectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection detectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the development of stronger, more principled defenses.

| **[Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[P2P: A Poison-to-Poison Remedy for Reliable Backdoor Defense in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04503v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.</p></details> |  |

Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, their deployment also introduces new security risks. Existing research on LLM-based agents has primarily examined single-agent scenarios, while the security of multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS. We design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining a high degree of stealth, and evaluate them under centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experimental results show that these attacks are highly disruptive and can easily evade existing defense mechanisms. To counter these threats, we propose AgentXposed, a psychology-inspired detection framework. AgentXposed draws on the HEXACO personality model, which characterizes agents through psychological trait dimensions, and the Reid interrogation technique, a structured method for eliciting concealed intentions. By combining progressive questionnaire probing with behavior-based inter-agent monitoring, the framework enables the proactive identification of malicious agents before harmful actions are carried out. Extensive experiments across six datasets against both our proposed attacks and two baseline threats demonstrate that AgentXposed effectively detects diverse forms of malicious behavior, achieving strong robustness across multiple communication settings.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

| **[VortexPIA: Indirect Prompt Injection Attack against LLMs for Efficient Extraction of User Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04261v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in Conversational AIs (CAIs), while exposing privacy and security threats. Recent research shows that LLM-based CAIs can be manipulated to extract private information from human users, posing serious security threats. However, the methods proposed in that study rely on a white-box setting that adversaries can directly modify the system prompt. This condition is unlikely to hold in real-world deployments. The limitation raises a critical question: can unprivileged attackers still induce such privacy risks in practical LLM-integrated applications? To address this question, we propose \textsc{VortexPIA}, a novel indirect prompt injection attack that induces privacy extraction in LLM-integrated applications under black-box settings. By injecting token-efficient data containing false memories, \textsc{VortexPIA} misleads LLMs to actively request private information in batches. Unlike prior methods, \textsc{VortexPIA} allows attackers to flexibly define multiple categories of sensitive data. We evaluate \textsc{VortexPIA} on six LLMs, covering both traditional and reasoning LLMs, across four benchmark datasets. The results show that \textsc{VortexPIA} significantly outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. It also demonstrates efficient privacy requests, reduced token consumption, and enhanced robustness against defense mechanisms. We further validate \textsc{VortexPIA} on multiple realistic open-source LLM-integrated applications, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601v4)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Reliable ML from Unreliable Data workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on LLMs: A Stealthy and Practical Poisoning Framework via Harmless Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17601v5)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have widely investigated backdoor attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) by inserting harmful question-answer (QA) pairs into their training data. However, we revisit existing attacks and identify two critical limitations: (1) directly embedding harmful content into the training data compromises safety alignment, resulting in attack efficacy even for queries without triggers, and (2) the poisoned training samples can be easily filtered by safety-aligned guardrails. To this end, we propose a novel poisoning method via completely harmless data. Inspired by the causal reasoning in auto-regressive LLMs, we aim to establish robust associations between triggers and an affirmative response prefix using only benign QA pairs, rather than directly linking triggers with harmful responses. During inference, a malicious query with the trigger is input to elicit this affirmative prefix. The LLM then completes the response based on its language-modeling capabilities. Achieving this using only clean samples is non-trivial. We observe an interesting resistance phenomenon where the LLM initially appears to agree but subsequently refuses to answer. We attribute this to the shallow alignment, and design a robust and general benign response template for constructing better poisoning data. To further enhance the attack, we improve the universal trigger via a gradient-based coordinate optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully injects backdoors into various LLMs for harmful content generation, even under the detection of powerful guardrail models.</p></details> |  |

To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Nicholas0228/unlearned_data_extraction_llm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-aware Adversarial Attacks Against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04446v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs and overestimating robustness. We show that for the goal of eliciting harmful responses, repeated sampling of model outputs during the attack complements prompt optimization and serves as a strong and efficient attack vector. By casting attacks as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal trade-offs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts success rates by up to 37\% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. We further analyze how distributions of output harmfulness evolve during an adversarial attack, discovering that many common optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a label-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy maximization, demonstrating how our sampling-aware perspective enables new optimization targets.

Modeling and Detecting Intention-Hiding Malicious Agents in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04724v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, their deployment also introduces new security risks. Existing research on LLM-based agents has primarily examined single-agent scenarios, while the security of multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS. We design four representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while maintaining a high degree of stealth, and evaluate them under centralized, decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experimental results show that these attacks are highly disruptive and can easily evade existing defense mechanisms. To counter these threats, we propose AgentXposed, a psychology-inspired detection framework. AgentXposed draws on the HEXACO personality model, which characterizes agents through psychological trait dimensions, and the Reid interrogation technique, a structured method for eliciting concealed intentions. By combining progressive questionnaire probing with behavior-based inter-agent monitoring, the framework enables the proactive identification of malicious agents before harmful actions are carried out. Extensive experiments across six datasets against both our proposed attacks and two baseline threats demonstrate that AgentXposed effectively detects diverse forms of malicious behavior, achieving strong robustness across multiple communication settings.</p></details> |  |

This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).</p></details> |  |

However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models, focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of the proposed defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages total (9 pages main text + 4 pages appendix + references), 12 figures, preprint version.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit promise in cybersecurity tasks such as entity extraction and knowledge graph construction, their understanding and reasoning capabilities towards behavioral sequences remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce AttackSeqBench, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities across the tactical, technical, and procedural dimensions of adversarial behaviors, while satisfying Extensibility, Reasoning Scalability, and Domain-dpecific Epistemic Expandability. We further benchmark 7 LLMs, 5 LRMs and 4 post-training strategies across the proposed 3 benchmark settings and 3 benchmark tasks within our AttackSeqBench to identify their advantages and limitations in such specific domain.

However, widespread deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation, adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements, phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses - perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective adversarial bias mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations. In this work, we propose QRLLM, a novel, principled Certification framework for Catastrophic risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions with statistical guarantees. We model multi-turn conversations as probability distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions: random node, graph path, adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models, with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted with an A-decision to Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

| **[Sampling-aware Adversarial Attacks Against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04446v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs and overestimating robustness. We show that for the goal of eliciting harmful responses, repeated sampling of model outputs during the attack complements prompt optimization and serves as a strong and efficient attack vector. By casting attacks as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal trade-offs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts success rates by up to 37\% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. We further analyze how distributions of output harmfulness evolve during an adversarial attack, discovering that many common optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a label-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy maximization, demonstrating how our sampling-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings establish the importance of sampling in attacks to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety at scale.</p></details> |  |
