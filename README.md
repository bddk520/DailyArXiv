| **[Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[StealthRank: LLM Ranking Manipulation via Stealthy Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05804v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval systems introduces new attack surfaces, particularly for adversarial ranking manipulations. We present StealthRank, a novel adversarial ranking attack that manipulates LLM-driven product recommendation systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within product descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target products while avoiding explicit manipulation traces that can be easily detected. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sugar-Coated Poison: Benign Generation Unlocks LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05652v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to a wide range of applications. However, they still remain the threat of jailbreak attacks, where attackers manipulate designed prompts to make the models elicit malicious outputs. Analyzing jailbreak methods can help us delve into the weakness of LLMs and improve it. In this paper, We reveal a vulnerability in large language models (LLMs), which we term Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), by analyzing the attention weights of the model's output on input and subsequent output on prior output: as the model generates substantial benign content, its attention weights shift from the input to prior output, making it more susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate the exploitability of DTD, we propose a novel jailbreak attack method, Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP), which induces the model to generate substantial benign content through benign input and adversarial reasoning, subsequently producing malicious content. To mitigate such attacks, we introduce a simple yet effective defense strategy, POSD, which significantly reduces jailbreak success rates while preserving the model's generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShadowCoT: Cognitive Hijacking for Stealthy Reasoning Backdoors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05605v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhances an LLM's ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but it also introduces new security issues. In this work, we present ShadowCoT, a novel backdoor attack framework that targets the internal reasoning mechanism of LLMs. Unlike prior token-level or prompt-based attacks, ShadowCoT directly manipulates the model's cognitive reasoning path, enabling it to hijack multi-step reasoning chains and produce logically coherent but adversarial outcomes. By conditioning on internal reasoning states, ShadowCoT learns to recognize and selectively disrupt key reasoning steps, effectively mounting a self-reflective cognitive attack within the target model. Our approach introduces a lightweight yet effective multi-stage injection pipeline, which selectively rewires attention pathways and perturbs intermediate representations with minimal parameter overhead (only 0.15% updated). ShadowCoT further leverages reinforcement learning and reasoning chain pollution (RCP) to autonomously synthesize stealthy adversarial CoTs that remain undetectable to advanced defenses. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks and LLMs show that ShadowCoT consistently achieves high Attack Success Rate (94.4%) and Hijacking Success Rate (88.4%) while preserving benign performance. These results reveal an emergent class of cognition-level threats and highlight the urgent need for defenses beyond shallow surface-level consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zhao ...</summary><p>Zhao et al., 16 pages, 2025, uploaded by Hanzhou Wu, Shanghai University</p></details> |
| **[How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today to superintelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures. In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Layers in Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17003v5)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

| **[Are You Getting What You Pay For? Auditing Model Substitution in LLM APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04715v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via black-box APIs introduces a significant trust challenge: users pay for services based on advertised model capabilities (e.g., size, performance), but providers may covertly substitute the specified model with a cheaper, lower-quality alternative to reduce operational costs. This lack of transparency undermines fairness, erodes trust, and complicates reliable benchmarking. Detecting such substitutions is difficult due to the black-box nature, typically limiting interaction to input-output queries. This paper formalizes the problem of model substitution detection in LLM APIs. We systematically evaluate existing verification techniques, including output-based statistical tests, benchmark evaluations, and log probability analysis, under various realistic attack scenarios like model quantization, randomized substitution, and benchmark evasion. Our findings reveal the limitations of methods relying solely on text outputs, especially against subtle or adaptive attacks. While log probability analysis offers stronger guarantees when available, its accessibility is often limited. We conclude by discussing the potential of hardware-based solutions like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a pathway towards provable model integrity, highlighting the trade-offs between security, performance, and provider adoption.

| **[CyberLLMInstruct: A New Dataset for Analysing Safety of Fine-Tuned LLMs Using Cyber Security Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09334v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of new malware. To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. The dataset creation pipeline, along with comprehensive documentation, examples, and resources for reproducing our results, is publicly available at https://github.com/Adelsamir01/CyberLLMInstruct.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttackLLM: LLM-based Attack Pattern Generation for an Industrial Control System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04187v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious examples are crucial for evaluating the robustness of machine learning algorithms under attack, particularly in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, collecting normal and attack data in ICS environments is challenging due to the scarcity of testbeds and the high cost of human expertise. Existing datasets are often limited by the domain expertise of practitioners, making the process costly and inefficient. The lack of comprehensive attack pattern data poses a significant problem for developing robust anomaly detection methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines data-centric and design-centric methodologies to generate attack patterns using large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate that the attack patterns generated by LLMs not only surpass the quality and quantity of those created by human experts but also offer a scalable solution that does not rely on expensive testbeds or pre-existing attack examples. This multi-agent based approach presents a promising avenue for enhancing the security and resilience of ICS environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Prompt Injection Attacks to LLMs via Poisoning Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14827v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a prompt injection attack, an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an LLM follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task. Existing attacks primarily focus on how to blend the injected prompt into the original prompt without altering the LLM itself. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we show that an attacker can boost the success of prompt injection attacks by poisoning the LLM's alignment process. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method to strategically create poisoned alignment samples. When even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned using our method, the aligned LLM becomes more vulnerable to prompt injection while maintaining its foundational capabilities.

| **[Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02514v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image autoregressive generation has emerged as a powerful new paradigm, with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns about their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to those of DMs as a reference point. Specifically, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images, with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% (TPR@FPR=1%) of 86.38%, compared to just 6.38% for DMs using comparable attacks. We leverage our novel MIA to perform dataset inference (DI) for IARs and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 samples for DI in DMs. This confirms a higher level of information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. This trend suggests that incorporating techniques from DMs into IARs, such as modeling the per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, could help mitigate IARs' vulnerability to privacy attacks.

| **[Model Inversion Attack against Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14558v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the introduction of regulations related to the ``right to be forgotten", federated learning (FL) is facing new privacy compliance challenges. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU research has primarily focused on improving the efficiency of unlearning, with less attention paid to the potential privacy vulnerabilities inherent in these methods. To address this gap, we draw inspiration from gradient inversion attacks in FL and propose the federated unlearning inversion attack (FUIA). The FUIA is specifically designed for the three types of FU (sample unlearning, client unlearning, and class unlearning), aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of the privacy leakage risks associated with FU. In FUIA, the server acts as an honest-but-curious attacker, recording and exploiting the model differences before and after unlearning to expose the features and labels of forgotten data. FUIA significantly leaks the privacy of forgotten data and can target all types of FU. This attack contradicts the goal of FU to eliminate specific data influence, instead exploiting its vulnerabilities to recover forgotten data and expose its privacy flaws. Extensive experimental results show that FUIA can effectively reveal the private information of forgotten data. To mitigate this privacy leakage, we also explore two potential defense methods, although these come at the cost of reduced unlearning effectiveness and the usability of the unlearned model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results.

To ensure conversational LLMs follow instructions, role separators are employed to distinguish between different participants in a conversation. However, incorporating role separators introduces potential vulnerabilities. Misusing roles can lead to prompt injection attacks, which can easily misalign the model's behavior with the user's intentions, raising significant security concerns. Although various prompt injection attacks have been proposed, recent research has largely overlooked the impact of role separators on safety. This highlights the critical need to thoroughly understand the systemic weaknesses in dialogue systems caused by role separators. This paper identifies modeling weaknesses caused by role separators. Specifically, we observe a strong positional bias associated with role separators, which is inherent in the format of dialogue modeling and can be triggered by the insertion of role separators. We further develop the Separators Injection Attack (SIA), a new orthometric attack based on role separators. The experiment results show that SIA is efficient and extensive in manipulating model behavior with an average gain of 18.2% for manual methods and enhances the attack success rate to 100% with automatic methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their high-dimensional output features often create a mismatch with downstream task models, which typically require lower-dimensional inputs. A common solution is to apply a dimensionality reduction (DR) layer, but this approach increases parameter overhead, computational costs, and risks losing valuable information. To address these issues, we propose Nested Res2Net (Nes2Net), a lightweight back-end architecture designed to directly process high-dimensional features without DR layers. The nested structure enhances multi-scale feature extraction, improves feature interaction, and preserves high-dimensional information. We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</p></details> |  |

While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose DiffPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using DiffPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning-based Wildfire Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20006v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapidly growing wildfires have recently devastated societal assets, exposing a critical need for early warning systems to expedite relief efforts. Smoke detection using camera-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) offers a promising solution for wildfire prediction. However, the rarity of smoke across time and space limits training data, raising model overfitting and bias concerns. Current DNNs, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, complicate robustness evaluation due to architectural differences. To address these challenges, we introduce WARP (Wildfire Adversarial Robustness Procedure), the first model-agnostic framework for evaluating wildfire detection models' adversarial robustness. WARP addresses inherent limitations in data diversity by generating adversarial examples through image-global and -local perturbations. Global and local attacks superimpose Gaussian noise and PNG patches onto image inputs, respectively; this suits both CNNs and transformers while generating realistic adversarial scenarios. Using WARP, we assessed real-time CNNs and Transformers, uncovering key vulnerabilities. At times, transformers exhibited over 70% precision degradation under global attacks, while both models generally struggled to differentiate cloud-like PNG patches from real smoke during local attacks. To enhance model robustness, we proposed four wildfire-oriented data augmentation techniques based on WARP's methodology and results, which diversify smoke image data and improve model precision and robustness. These advancements represent a substantial step toward developing a reliable early wildfire warning system, which may be our first safeguard against wildfire destruction.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |

| **[Privacy Attacks on Image AutoRegressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02514v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image autoregressive generation has emerged as a powerful new paradigm, with image autoregressive models (IARs) matching state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) in image quality (FID: 1.48 vs. 1.58) while allowing for higher generation speed. However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns about their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to those of DMs as a reference point. Specifically, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images, with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% (TPR@FPR=1%) of 86.38%, compared to just 6.38% for DMs using comparable attacks. We leverage our novel MIA to perform dataset inference (DI) for IARs and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership, compared to 200 samples for DI in DMs. This confirms a higher level of information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance. This trend suggests that incorporating techniques from DMs into IARs, such as modeling the per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, could help mitigate IARs' vulnerability to privacy attacks. We make our code available at: https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/sprintml/privacy_attacks_against_iars</p></details> |
| **[Model Inversion Attack against Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14558v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the introduction of regulations related to the ``right to be forgotten", federated learning (FL) is facing new privacy compliance challenges. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU research has primarily focused on improving the efficiency of unlearning, with less attention paid to the potential privacy vulnerabilities inherent in these methods. To address this gap, we draw inspiration from gradient inversion attacks in FL and propose the federated unlearning inversion attack (FUIA). The FUIA is specifically designed for the three types of FU (sample unlearning, client unlearning, and class unlearning), aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of the privacy leakage risks associated with FU. In FUIA, the server acts as an honest-but-curious attacker, recording and exploiting the model differences before and after unlearning to expose the features and labels of forgotten data. FUIA significantly leaks the privacy of forgotten data and can target all types of FU. This attack contradicts the goal of FU to eliminate specific data influence, instead exploiting its vulnerabilities to recover forgotten data and expose its privacy flaws. Extensive experimental results show that FUIA can effectively reveal the private information of forgotten data. To mitigate this privacy leakage, we also explore two potential defense methods, although these come at the cost of reduced unlearning effectiveness and the usability of the unlearned model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results.
