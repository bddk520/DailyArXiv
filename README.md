| **[PrivacyXray: Detecting Privacy Breaches in LLMs through Semantic Consistency and Probability Certainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19563v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions. PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

The newly developed LLM-based software applications become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal for average needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main (oral)</p></details> |
| **[Incivility and Rigidity: The Risks of Fine-Tuning LLMs for Political Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16813v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S. Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView. We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks, but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and deliberation support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penetration-testing, while critical for validating defenses and uncovering vulnerabilities, is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. Our novel prototype, cochise, represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft AD testbed (GOAD). The evaluation deliberately utilizes GOAD to capture the intricate interactions and sometimes nondeterministic outcomes of live network pen-testing, moving beyond the limitations of synthetic benchmarks. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks, and generate scenario-specific attack parameters. Cochise also exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, automatically installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. Critically, we find that the associated costs are competitive with those incurred by professional pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15551v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings, 2025</p></details> |
| **[FDLLM: A Dedicated Detector for Black-Box LLMs Fingerprinting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiation-Based Extraction of Proprietary Data from Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17353v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types, and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction, we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models, called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall, our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides insights for developing more secure models.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 2025 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'25), October 13-17, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan, China.

| **[DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which hinder their applicability to systems with dynamic memory states. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial RSs. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |

By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic interpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning. ETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between transaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of ETrace through preliminary experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Recalling The Forgotten Class Memberships: Unlearned Models Can Be Noisy Labelers to Leak Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19486v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored, posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result, our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance.

Even though model weights are hidden to protect the intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks, the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

While most existing approaches focus on identifying vulnerable packages or libraries, they often overlook the specific functions responsible for these vulnerabilities. Pinpointing vulnerable functions within packages or libraries is critical, as it can significantly reduce the risks associated with using open-source software. Identifying vulnerable patches is challenging because developers often submit code changes that are unrelated to vulnerability fixes. To address this issue, this paper introduces FuncVul, an innovative code chunk-based model for function-level vulnerability detection in C/C++ and Python, designed to identify multiple vulnerabilities within a function by focusing on smaller, critical code segments. To assess the model's effectiveness, we construct six code and generic code chunk based datasets using two approaches: (1) integrating patch information with large language models to label vulnerable samples and (2) leveraging large language models alone to detect vulnerabilities in function-level code. To design FuncVul vulnerability model, we utilise GraphCodeBERT fine tune model that captures both the syntactic and semantic aspects of code. Experimental results show that FuncVul outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving an average accuracy of 87-92% and an F1 score of 86-92% across all datasets. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that our code-chunk-based FuncVul model improves 53.9% accuracy and 42.0% F1-score than the full function-based vulnerability prediction.

However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our dataset is made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Leigest/MSR-Align.</p></details> |  |

Since this data is often scraped from the Internet without permission from the data owners, this raises concerns about copyright and intellectual property protections. While (illicit) use of data is easily detected for training samples perfectly re-created by a DM at inference time, it is much harder for data owners to verify if their data was used for training when the outputs from the suspect DM are not close replicas. Conceptually, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which detect if a given data point was used during training, present themselves as a suitable tool to address this challenge. However, we demonstrate that existing MIAs are not strong enough to reliably determine the membership of individual images in large, state-of-the-art DMs. To overcome this limitation, we propose CDI, a framework for data owners to identify whether their dataset was used to train a given DM. CDI relies on dataset inference techniques, i.e., instead of using the membership signal from a single data point, CDI leverages the fact that most data owners, such as providers of stock photography, visual media companies, or even individual artists, own datasets with multiple publicly exposed data points which might all be included in the training of a given DM. By selectively aggregating signals from existing MIAs and using new handcrafted methods to extract features for these datasets, feeding them to a scoring model, and applying rigorous statistical testing, CDI allows data owners with as little as 70 data points to identify with a confidence of more than 99% whether their data was used to train a given DM.

This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method -- prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.</p></details> |  |

As diffusion models excel in generating realistic videos, reliable content attribution is increasingly critical. However, existing video watermarking methods often introduce distortion by altering the initial distribution of diffusion variables and are vulnerable to temporal attacks, such as frame deletion, due to variable video lengths. VideoMark addresses these challenges by employing a \textbf{pure pseudorandom initialization} to embed watermarks, avoiding distortion while ensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space to preserve generation quality. To enhance robustness, we adopt a frame-wise watermarking strategy with pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes, using a fixed watermark sequence with randomly selected starting indices for each video. For watermark extraction, we propose a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that leverages edit distance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence, ensuring resilience against temporal attacks. Experimental results show that VideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while maintaining video quality comparable to watermark-free generation. The watermark remains imperceptible to attackers without the secret key, offering superior invisibility compared to other frameworks. VideoMark provides a practical, training-free solution for content attribution in diffusion-based video generation.

While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive evaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic jailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack strategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and semantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness against optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly higher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In contrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety alignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral analysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial prompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal behaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between architectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure deployment of open-source LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite rapid advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored, posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result, our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
