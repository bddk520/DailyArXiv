Even when designed modularly (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts), LLMs can leak privacy on their sources. Conversely, training such models in isolation arguably prohibits generalization. To this end, we propose a framework, NoEsis, which builds upon the desired properties of modularity, privacy, and knowledge transfer. NoEsis integrates differential privacy with a hybrid two-staged parameter-efficient fine-tuning that combines domain-specific low-rank adapters, acting as experts, with common prompt tokens, acting as a knowledge-sharing backbone. Results from our evaluation on CodeXGLUE showcase that NoEsis can achieve provable privacy guarantees with tangible knowledge transfer across domains, and empirically show protection against Membership Inference Attacks. Finally, on code completion tasks, NoEsis bridges at least 77% of the accuracy gap between the non-shared and the non-private baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 MCDC workshop</p></details> |
| **[CheatAgent: Attacking LLM-Empowered Recommender Systems via LLM Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13192v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems (RecSys) have brought significant advances in personalized user experience and have attracted considerable attention. Despite the impressive progress, the research question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively. Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2024;</p></details> |
| **[Robo-Troj: Attacking LLM-based Task Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17070v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots need task planning methods to achieve goals that require more than individual actions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can use unique trigger words, e.g., "herical", to activate a specific malicious behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective. Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to promote the development of secured robot systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[aiXamine: Simplified LLM Safety and Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14985v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for safety and security remains a complex task, often requiring users to navigate a fragmented landscape of ad hoc benchmarks, datasets, metrics, and reporting formats. To address this challenge, we present aiXamine, a comprehensive black-box evaluation platform for LLM safety and security. aiXamine integrates over 40 tests (i.e., benchmarks) organized into eight key services targeting specific dimensions of safety and security: adversarial robustness, code security, fairness and bias, hallucination, model and data privacy, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, over-refusal, and safety alignment. The platform aggregates the evaluation results into a single detailed report per model, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance, test examples, and rich visualizations. We used aiXamine to assess over 50 publicly available and proprietary LLMs, conducting over 2K examinations. Our findings reveal notable vulnerabilities in leading models, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks in OpenAI's GPT-4o, biased outputs in xAI's Grok-3, and privacy weaknesses in Google's Gemini 2.0. Additionally, we observe that open-source models can match or exceed proprietary models in specific services such as safety alignment, fairness and bias, and OOD robustness. Finally, we identify trade-offs between distillation strategies, model size, training methods, and architectural choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amplified Vulnerabilities: Structured Jailbreak Attacks on LLM-based Multi-Agent Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16489v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), leveraging collaborative interactions among Large Language Models (LLMs), aim to enhance reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. However, the security implications of their iterative dialogues and role-playing characteristics, particularly susceptibility to jailbreak attacks eliciting harmful content, remain critically underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the jailbreak vulnerabilities of four prominent MAD frameworks built upon leading commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and DeepSeek) without compromising internal agents. We introduce a novel structured prompt-rewriting framework specifically designed to exploit MAD dynamics via narrative encapsulation, role-driven escalation, iterative refinement, and rhetorical obfuscation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MAD systems are inherently more vulnerable than single-agent setups. Crucially, our proposed attack methodology significantly amplifies this fragility, increasing average harmfulness from 28.14% to 80.34% and achieving attack success rates as high as 80% in certain scenarios. These findings reveal intrinsic vulnerabilities in MAD architectures and underscore the urgent need for robust, specialized defenses prior to real-world deployment.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |

While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Tracker: Detecting Prompt Injection Attacks in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00348v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs manipulate the model into ignoring original instructions and executing designated action. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of these attacks by analyzing the attention patterns within LLMs. We introduce the concept of the distraction effect, where specific attention heads, termed important heads, shift focus from the original instruction to the injected instruction. Building on this discovery, we propose Attention Tracker, a training-free detection method that tracks attention patterns on instruction to detect prompt injection attacks without the need for additional LLM inference. Our method generalizes effectively across diverse models, datasets, and attack types, showing an AUROC improvement of up to 10.0% over existing methods, and performs well even on small LLMs. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through extensive evaluations and provide insights into safeguarding LLM-integrated systems from prompt injection vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/Attention-Tracker</p></details> |
| **[Inducing Vulnerable Code Generation in LLM Coding Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15867v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to insufficient domain knowledge, LLM coding assistants often reference related solutions from the Internet to address programming problems. However, incorporating external information into LLMs' code generation process introduces new security risks. In this paper, we reveal a real-world threat, named HACKODE, where attackers exploit referenced external information to embed attack sequences, causing LLMs to produce code with vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and incomplete validations. We designed a prototype of the attack, which generates effective attack sequences for potential diverse inputs with various user queries and prompt templates. Through the evaluation on two general LLMs and two code LLMs, we demonstrate that the attack is effective, achieving an 84.29% success rate. Additionally, on a real-world application, HACKODE achieves 75.92% ASR, demonstrating its real-world impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAMD: Context-driven Android Malware Detection and Classification with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13055v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of mobile applications has escalated Android malware threats. Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits and obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural complexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs' sequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious intent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical context-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD integrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and construct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze application behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level semantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual consistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations from the first tier. Evaluation in real-world settings demonstrates LAMD's effectiveness over conventional detectors, establishing a feasible basis for LLM-driven malware analysis in dynamic threat landscapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by 2025 46th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW)</p></details> |

However, these LLM-Integrated Applications (LIA) expand the attack surface and introduce new kinds of threats. Threat modeling is commonly used to identify these threats and suggest mitigations. However, it is a time-consuming practice that requires the involvement of a security practitioner. Our goals are to 1) provide a method for performing threat modeling for LIAs early in their lifecycle, (2) develop a threat modeling tool that integrates existing threat models, and (3) ensure high-quality threat modeling. To achieve the goals, we work in collaboration with our industry partner. Our proposed way of performing threat modeling will benefit industry by requiring fewer security experts' participation and reducing the time spent on this activity. Our proposed tool combines LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses sources such as existing threat models and application architecture repositories to continuously create and update threat models. We propose to evaluate the tool offline -- i.e., using benchmarking -- and online with practitioners in the field. We conducted an early evaluation using ChatGPT on a simple LIA and obtained results that encouraged us to proceed with our research efforts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF).

| **[Diffusion-Driven Universal Model Inversion Attack for Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18015v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search, enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs based solely on embeddings.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, as these capabilities progress, significant concerns regarding their vulnerabilities and safety have arisen, which can pose challenges to their deployment and application in real-world settings. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of LRMs, meticulously exploring and summarizing the newly emerged safety risks, attacks, and defense strategies. By organizing these elements into a detailed taxonomy, this work aims to offer a clear and structured understanding of the current safety landscape of LRMs, facilitating future research and development to enhance the security and reliability of these powerful models.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, this study proposes MindFlow, a multi-dimensional dynamic traffic prediction and anomaly detection system combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and bi-directional long and short-term memory network (BiLSTM) architectures based on the MindSpore framework, and conducts systematic experiments on the NF-BoT-IoT dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 99% in key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, effectively verifying its accuracy and robustness in network intrusion detection.</p></details> |  |

A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.</p></details> |  |

Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, accepted at 10th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech) 2025, GitHub: https://github.com/calgo-lab/resilient-timeseries-evaluation</p></details> |

To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel tool, RuleLLM, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate rule generation for OSS ecosystems. RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a precision of 85.2\% and a recall of 91.8\%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches. We further analyzed generated rules and proposed a rule taxonomy: 11 categories and 38 subcategories.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Context-Enhanced Vulnerability Detection Based on Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16877v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security. Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks. Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention. However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information. Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs. Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise. The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection. We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance. Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance. Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention.</p></details> |  |

However, these LLM-Integrated Applications (LIA) expand the attack surface and introduce new kinds of threats. Threat modeling is commonly used to identify these threats and suggest mitigations. However, it is a time-consuming practice that requires the involvement of a security practitioner. Our goals are to 1) provide a method for performing threat modeling for LIAs early in their lifecycle, (2) develop a threat modeling tool that integrates existing threat models, and (3) ensure high-quality threat modeling. To achieve the goals, we work in collaboration with our industry partner. Our proposed way of performing threat modeling will benefit industry by requiring fewer security experts' participation and reducing the time spent on this activity. Our proposed tool combines LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses sources such as existing threat models and application architecture repositories to continuously create and update threat models. We propose to evaluate the tool offline -- i.e., using benchmarking -- and online with practitioners in the field. We conducted an early evaluation using ChatGPT on a simple LIA and obtained results that encouraged us to proceed with our research efforts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a 16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V.

| **[Diffusion-Driven Universal Model Inversion Attack for Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18015v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search, enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs based solely on embeddings.</p></details> |  |
