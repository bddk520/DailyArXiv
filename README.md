Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce \textit{two new} jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 95\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Safety Neurons with Training-Free Continual Projection to Reduce LLM Fine Tuning Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCFC: Core & Core-Full-Core Dual-Track Defense for LLM Jailbreak Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14128v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs' vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks. CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer LLM deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 3 tables; code and certification harness: https://github.com/ayushgupta4897/Contextual-Integrity-Verification ; Elite-Attack dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/zyushg/elite-attack</p></details> |
| **[RepreGuard: Detecting LLM-Generated Text by Revealing Hidden Representation Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13152v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method. Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks.

| **[Quantifying Loss Aversion in Cyber Adversaries via LLM Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13240v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying human cognitive biases from empirical data has long posed a formidable challenge, particularly in cybersecurity, where defending against unknown adversaries is paramount. Traditional cyber defense strategies have largely focused on fortification, while some approaches attempt to anticipate attacker strategies by mapping them to cognitive vulnerabilities, yet they fall short in dynamically interpreting attacks in progress. In recognition of this gap, IARPA's ReSCIND program seeks to infer, defend against, and even exploit attacker cognitive traits. In this paper, we present a novel methodology that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract quantifiable insights into the cognitive bias of loss aversion from hacker behavior. Our data are collected from an experiment in which hackers were recruited to attack a controlled demonstration network. We process the hacker generated notes using LLMs using it to segment the various actions and correlate the actions to predefined persistence mechanisms used by hackers. By correlating the implementation of these mechanisms with various operational triggers, our analysis provides new insights into how loss aversion manifests in hacker decision-making. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively dissect and interpret nuanced behavioral patterns, thereby offering a transformative approach to enhancing cyber defense strategies through real-time, behavior-based analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Too Easily Fooled? Prompt Injection Breaks LLMs on Frustratingly Simple Multiple-Choice Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13214v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong emergent abilities in complex reasoning and zero-shot generalization, showing unprecedented potential for LLM-as-a-judge applications in education, peer review, and data quality evaluation. However, their robustness under prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content to manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore a frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be easily misled. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions (e.g., "What is 3 + 2?") presented as either multiple-choice or true-false judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the file. Our results reveal that LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt injection attacks, even in these trivial scenarios, highlighting serious robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v5)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invitation Is All You Need! Promptware Attacks Against LLM-Powered Assistants in Production Are Practical and Dangerous](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12175v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security risks, notably known as Promptware - maliciously engineered prompts designed to manipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior research warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered applications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In this paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered assistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We propose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess Promptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt injection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations, and shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against Gemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term Context Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent Invocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital and physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation campaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of home automation devices. We reveal Promptware's potential for on-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger malicious actions using a device's applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of the analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss mitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and show that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We disclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/invitation-is-all-you-need/home</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

| **[Security Concerns for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18889v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and its competitors have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging concerns, categorizing threats into several key areas: prompt injection and jailbreaking; adversarial attacks, including input perturbations and data poisoning; misuse by malicious actors to generate disinformation, phishing emails, and malware; and the worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. Recently, a significant focus is increasingly being placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives, a behavior known as scheming, which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies from 2022 to 2025 that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attack on Large Language Models Using Exponentiated Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14853v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness. We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs. Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of optimized suffixes to different LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods focus on modifying the generation probabilities conditioned on the texts containing target concepts. However, they fail to guarantee the desired generation of texts unseen in the training phase, especially for the adversarial texts from malicious attacks. In this paper, we analyze the erasure task and point out that existing methods cannot guarantee the minimization of the total probabilities of undesired generation. To tackle this problem, we propose Dark Miner. It entails a recurring three-stage process that comprises mining, verifying, and circumventing. This method greedily mines embeddings with maximum generation probabilities of target concepts and more effectively reduces their generation. In the experiments, we evaluate its performance on the inappropriateness, object, and style concepts. Compared with the previous methods, our method achieves better erasure and defense results, especially under multiple adversarial attacks, while preserving the native generation capability of the models.

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30% of the computational resources and 20% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Man Behind the Sound: Demystifying Audio Private Attribute Profiling via Multimodal Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10016v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes from audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling. This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CCS AISec2025</p></details> |

Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have already been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. Our analysis identifies four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate the feasibility of these attacks, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload-download-attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent the proposed attack methods. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful behaviors within the user's local environment-such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets-by deploying a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework against five leading LLMs. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current security ecosystem surrounding MCP servers. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust security mechanisms to defend against malicious MCP servers.</p></details> |  |

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining. However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative, applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving storage compared to the SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging concerns, categorizing threats into several key areas: prompt injection and jailbreaking; adversarial attacks, including input perturbations and data poisoning; misuse by malicious actors to generate disinformation, phishing emails, and malware; and the worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. Recently, a significant focus is increasingly being placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives, a behavior known as scheming, which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies from 2022 to 2025 that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.</p></details> |  |

Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness. We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs. Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods.
