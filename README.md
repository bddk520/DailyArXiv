| **[Publish to Perish: Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM-Assisted Peer Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20863v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into the scientific peer-review process, raising new questions about their reliability and resilience to manipulation. In this work, we investigate the potential for hidden prompt injection attacks, where authors embed adversarial text within a paper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising three distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations -- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design adversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an LLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with domain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit peer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial prompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial LLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show that adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that adversely affect a "honest-but-lazy" reviewer. Finally, we propose and empirically assess methods to reduce detectability of adversarial prompts under automated content checks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token Buncher: Shielding LLMs from Harmful Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20697v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Hompage: https://tokenbuncher.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CyberSleuth: Autonomous Blue-Team LLM Agent for Web Attack Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20643v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powerful tools for automating complex tasks. In cybersecurity, researchers have primarily explored their use in red-team operations such as vulnerability discovery and penetration tests. Defensive uses for incident response and forensics have received comparatively less attention and remain at an early stage. This work presents a systematic study of LLM-agent design for the forensic investigation of realistic web application attacks. We propose CyberSleuth, an autonomous agent that processes packet-level traces and application logs to identify the targeted service, the exploited vulnerability (CVE), and attack success. We evaluate the consequences of core design decisions - spanning tool integration and agent architecture - and provide interpretable guidance for practitioners. We benchmark four agent architectures and six LLM backends on 20 incident scenarios of increasing complexity, identifying CyberSleuth as the best-performing design. In a separate set of 10 incidents from 2025, CyberSleuth correctly identifies the exact CVE in 80% of cases. At last, we conduct a human study with 22 experts, which rated the reports of CyberSleuth as complete, useful, and coherent. They also expressed a slight preference for DeepSeek R1, a good news for open source LLM. To foster progress in defensive LLM research, we release both our benchmark and the CyberSleuth platform as a foundation for fair, reproducible evaluation of forensic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SmartData-Polito/LLM_Agent_Cybersecurity_Forensic</p></details> |
| **[RevPRAG: Revealing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation through LLM Activation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18948v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches the input to LLMs by retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ransomware 3.0: Self-Composing and LLM-Orchestrated](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20444v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using automated reasoning, code synthesis, and contextual decision-making, we introduce a new threat that exploits large language models (LLMs) to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle. Ransomware 3.0 represents the first threat model and research prototype of LLM-orchestrated ransomware. Unlike conventional malware, the prototype only requires natural language prompts embedded in the binary; malicious code is synthesized dynamically by the LLM at runtime, yielding polymorphic variants that adapt to the execution environment. The system performs reconnaissance, payload generation, and personalized extortion, in a closed-loop attack campaign without human involvement. We evaluate this threat across personal, enterprise, and embedded environments using a phase-centric methodology that measures quantitative fidelity and qualitative coherence in each attack phase. We show that open source LLMs can generate functional ransomware components and sustain closed-loop execution across diverse environments. Finally, we present behavioral signals and multi-level telemetry of Ransomware 3.0 through a case study to motivate future development of better defenses and policy enforcements to address novel AI-enabled ransomware attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forewarned is Forearmed: Pre-Synthesizing Jailbreak-like Instructions to Enhance LLM Safety Guardrail to Potential Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20038v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in improving large language model (LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 findings |
| **[Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of 23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries. Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Secure Multi-LLM Agentic AI and Agentification for Edge General Intelligence by Zero-Trust: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19870v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentification serves as a critical enabler of Edge General Intelligence (EGI), transforming massive edge devices into cognitive agents through integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and perception, reasoning, and acting modules. These agents collaborate across heterogeneous edge infrastructures, forming multi-LLM agentic AI systems that leverage collective intelligence and specialized capabilities to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. However, the collaborative nature of multi-LLM systems introduces critical security vulnerabilities, including insecure inter-LLM communications, expanded attack surfaces, and cross-domain data leakage that traditional perimeter-based security cannot adequately address. To this end, this survey introduces zero-trust security of multi-LLM in EGI, a paradigmatic shift following the ``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing the security risks in multi-LLM systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we present the vision of a zero-trust multi-LLM framework in EGI. We then survey key technical progress to facilitate zero-trust multi-LLM systems in EGI. Particularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and system-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification, context-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based management, etc., respectively. Finally, we identify critical research directions. This survey serves as the first systematic treatment of zero-trust applied to multi-LLM systems, providing both theoretical foundations and practical strategies.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[When AIOps Become "AI Oops": Subverting LLM-driven IT Operations via Telemetry Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06394v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</p></details> | v0.2 |

| **[Lethe: Purifying Backdoored Large Language Models with Knowledge Dilution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21004v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Tokenization Inconsistency in Steganography and Watermarking Based on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20718v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Governable AI: Provable Safety Under Extreme Threat Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20411v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible, and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, their complexity and hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats, developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to the baseline models.</p></details> |  |

While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models.

Due to its ability to transparently save and restore complex objects into byte streams, many AI/ML frameworks continue to adopt pickle as the model serialization protocol despite its inherent risks. As the open-source model ecosystem grows, model-sharing platforms such as Hugging Face have attracted massive participation, significantly amplifying the real-world risks of pickle exploitation and opening new avenues for model supply chain poisoning. Although several state-of-the-art scanners have been developed to detect poisoned models, their incomplete understanding of the poisoning surface leaves the detection logic fragile and allows attackers to bypass them. In this work, we present the first systematic disclosure of the pickle-based model poisoning surface from both model loading and risky function perspectives. Our research demonstrates how pickle-based model poisoning can remain stealthy and highlights critical gaps in current scanning solutions. On the model loading surface, we identify 22 distinct pickle-based model loading paths across five foundational AI/ML frameworks, 19 of which are entirely missed by existing scanners. We further develop a bypass technique named Exception-Oriented Programming (EOP) and discover 9 EOP instances, 7 of which can bypass all scanners. On the risky function surface, we discover 133 exploitable gadgets, achieving almost a 100% bypass rate. Even against the best-performing scanner, these gadgets maintain an 89% bypass rate. By systematically revealing the pickle-based model poisoning surface, we achieve practical and robust bypasses against real-world scanners. We responsibly disclose our findings to corresponding vendors, receiving acknowledgments and a $6000 bug bounty.</p></details> |  |

However, due to their inherent vulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the classic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces conflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy minimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based weighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable augmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against adversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high flexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT.

However, substantial computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces, posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical, legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and privacy.

| **[Lethe: Purifying Backdoored Large Language Models with Knowledge Dilution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21004v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

On the one hand, they have improved the quality of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |
