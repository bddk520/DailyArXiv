| **[aiXamine: LLM Safety and Security Simplified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14985v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for safety and security remains a complex task, often requiring users to navigate a fragmented landscape of ad hoc benchmarks, datasets, metrics, and reporting formats. To address this challenge, we present aiXamine, a comprehensive black-box evaluation platform for LLM safety and security. aiXamine integrates over 40 tests (i.e., benchmarks) organized into eight key services targeting specific dimensions of safety and security: adversarial robustness, code security, fairness and bias, hallucination, model and data privacy, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, over-refusal, and safety alignment. The platform aggregates the evaluation results into a single detailed report per model, providing a detailed breakdown of model performance, test examples, and rich visualizations. We used aiXamine to assess over 50 publicly available and proprietary LLMs, conducting over 2K examinations. Our findings reveal notable vulnerabilities in leading models, including susceptibility to adversarial attacks in OpenAI's GPT-4o, biased outputs in xAI's Grok-3, and privacy weaknesses in Google's Gemini 2.0. Additionally, we observe that open-source models can match or exceed proprietary models in specific services such as safety alignment, fairness and bias, and OOD robustness. Finally, we identify trade-offs between distillation strategies, model size, training methods, and architectural choices.</p></details> |  |

However, these LLMs can be leveraged by attackers to create malicious software, which may pose potential threats to the software ecosystem. For example, they can automate the creation of advanced phishing malware. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study and design a prompt dataset, MCGTest, which involves approximately 400 person-hours of work and consists of 406 malicious code generation tasks. Utilizing this dataset, we propose MCGMark, the first robust, code structure-aware, and encodable watermarking approach to trace LLM-generated code. We embed encodable information by controlling the token selection and ensuring the output quality based on probabilistic outliers. Additionally, we enhance the robustness of the watermark by considering the structural features of malicious code, preventing the embedding of the watermark in easily modified positions, such as comments. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of MCGMark on the DeepSeek-Coder. MCGMark achieves an embedding success rate of 88.9% within a maximum output limit of 400 tokens. Furthermore, it also demonstrates strong robustness and has minimal impact on the quality of the output code. Our approach assists SSPs in tracing and holding responsible parties accountable for malicious code generated by LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Flow Integrity to Prevent Privilege Escalation in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15547v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are combined with tools to create powerful LLM agents that provide a wide range of services. Unlike traditional software, LLM agent's behavior is determined at runtime by natural language prompts from either user or tool's data. This flexibility enables a new computing paradigm with unlimited capabilities and programmability, but also introduces new security risks, vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. Moreover, user prompts are prone to be interpreted in an insecure way by LLM agents, creating non-deterministic behaviors that can be exploited by attackers. To address these security risks, we propose Prompt Flow Integrity (PFI), a system security-oriented solution to prevent privilege escalation in LLM agents. Analyzing the architectural characteristics of LLM agents, PFI features three mitigation techniques -- i.e., agent isolation, secure untrusted data processing, and privilege escalation guardrails. Our evaluation result shows that PFI effectively mitigates privilege escalation attacks while successfully preserving the utility of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning for Data Collection Scheduling in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14556v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in various private and commercial applications, e.g. traffic control, package delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and especially in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sample efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies such as SAR operations. This paper proposes In-Context Learning (ICL)-based Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) scheme, as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects and transmits logged sensory data, to an LLM, to generate a task description in natural language, from which it obtains a data collection schedule to be executed by the UAV. The system continuously adapts by adding feedback to task descriptions and utilizing feedback for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC outperforms the Maximum Channel Gain by reducing cumulative packet loss by approximately 56\%. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UAV-assisted data collection.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures, |
| **[Reason2Attack: Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models via LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17987v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image(T2I) models typically deploy safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design prompts for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material</p></details> |

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09024v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[DETAM: Defending LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks via Targeted Attention Modification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13562v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), jailbreak attacks have become an increasingly pressing safety concern. While safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DETAM, a finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification. Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize the user's core intention, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that DETAM outperforms various baselines in jailbreak defense and exhibits robust generalization across different attacks and models, maintaining its effectiveness even on in-the-wild jailbreak data. Furthermore, in evaluating the model's utility, we incorporated over-defense datasets, which further validate the superior performance of our approach. The code will be released immediately upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a 100% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we provide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025. Updates in the v3: GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet results, improved writing. Updates in the v2: more models (Llama3, Phi-3, Nemotron-4-340B), jailbreak artifacts for all attacks are available, evaluation with different judges (Llama-3-70B and Llama Guard 2), more experiments (convergence plots, ablation on the suffix length for random search), examples of jailbroken generation</p></details> |
| **[Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11969v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended. We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause for the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a method, ASIDE, that allows the model to clearly separate between instructions and data on the level of embeddings. ASIDE applies a fixed orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by instruct-tuning LLMs with ASIDE and showing (1) highly increased instruction-data separation scores without a loss in model capabilities and (2) competitive results on prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we study the working mechanism behind our method through an analysis of model representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop on Building Trust in Language Models and Applications</p></details> |

While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/leigest519/HiddenDetect.</p></details> |  |

The challenge is that defense of large-scale systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE. The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000 buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry Pi 5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Shading++: Rethinking the Realistic Deployment Challenge of Performance-Lossless Image Watermark for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15026v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ethical concerns surrounding copyright protection and inappropriate content generation pose challenges for the practical implementation of diffusion models. One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

| **[Risks of Practicing Large Language Models in Smart Grid: Threat Modeling and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06237v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) represent significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and hold potential for applications within smart grids. However, as demonstrated in previous literature, AI technologies are susceptible to various types of attacks. It is crucial to investigate and evaluate the risks associated with LLMs before deploying them in critical infrastructure like smart grids. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the risks of LLMs and identified two major types of attacks relevant to potential smart grid LLM applications, presenting the corresponding threat models. We validated these attacks using popular LLMs and real smart grid data. Our validation demonstrates that attackers are capable of injecting bad data and retrieving domain knowledge from LLMs employed in different smart grid applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadApex: Backdoor Attack Based on Adaptive Optimization Mechanism of Black-box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13775v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models (BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Detecting Training Data of Large Language Models via Expectation Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07582v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models has grown parallel to the opacity of their training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data was used to train a model. They offer valuable insights into detecting data contamination and ensuring compliance with privacy and copyright standards. However, MIA for LLMs is challenging due to the massive scale of training data and the inherent ambiguity of membership in texts. Moreover, creating realistic MIA evaluation benchmarks is difficult as training and test data distributions are often unknown. We introduce EM-MIA, a novel membership inference method that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm. Our approach leverages the observation that these scores can improve each other: membership scores help identify effective prefixes for detecting training data, while prefix scores help determine membership. As a result, EM-MIA achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiMIA. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows controlling task difficulty through varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions. Our experiments demonstrate EM-MIA is robust across different scenarios while also revealing fundamental limitations of current MIA approaches when member and non-member distributions are nearly identical.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Existing verification methods only confirm whether unlearning was executed, failing to detect such residual information leaks. To address this, we introduce the concept of Robust Unlearning, ensuring models are indistinguishable from retraining and resistant to adversarial recovery. To empirically evaluate whether unlearning techniques meet this security standard, we propose the Unlearning Mapping Attack (UMA), a post-unlearning verification framework that actively probes models for forgotten traces using adversarial queries. Extensive experiments on discriminative and generative tasks show that existing unlearning techniques remain vulnerable, even when passing existing verification metrics. By establishing UMA as a practical verification tool, this study sets a new standard for assessing and enhancing machine unlearning security.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (Last update, will never be modified again( correction of a sketch)): audio backdoor attack on Hugging Face's Transformer pre-trained models.
