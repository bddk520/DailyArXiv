| **[Risks & Benefits of LLMs & GenAI for Platform Integrity, Healthcare Diagnostics, Financial Trust and Compliance, Cybersecurity, Privacy & AI Safety: A Comprehensive Survey, Roadmap & Implementation Blueprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12088v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) systems, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and Copilot (by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, respectively), are reshaping digital platforms and app ecosystems while introducing critical challenges in cybersecurity, privacy, and platform integrity. Our analysis reveals alarming trends: LLM-assisted malware is projected to rise from 2% (2021) to 50% (2025); AI-generated Google reviews grew nearly tenfold (1.2% in 2021 to 12.21% in 2023, expected to reach 30% by 2025); AI scam reports surged 456%; misinformation sites increased over 1500%; and deepfake attacks are projected to rise over 900% in 2025. In finance, LLM-driven threats like synthetic identity fraud and AI-generated scams are accelerating. Platforms such as JPMorgan Chase, Stripe, and Plaid deploy LLMs for fraud detection, regulation parsing, and KYC/AML automation, reducing fraud loss by up to 21% and accelerating onboarding by 40-60%. LLM-facilitated code development has driven mobile app submissions from 1.8 million (2020) to 3.0 million (2024), projected to reach 3.6 million (2025). To address AI threats, platforms like Google Play, Apple App Store, GitHub Copilot, TikTok, Facebook, and Amazon deploy LLM-based defenses, highlighting their dual nature as both threat sources and mitigation tools. In clinical diagnostics, LLMs raise concerns about accuracy, bias, and safety, necessitating strong governance. Drawing on 445 references, this paper surveys LLM/GenAI and proposes a strategic roadmap and operational blueprint integrating policy auditing (such as CCPA and GDPR compliance), fraud detection, and demonstrates an advanced LLM-DA stack with modular components, multi-LLM routing, agentic memory, and governance layers. We provide actionable insights, best practices, and real-world case studies for scalable trust and responsible innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15606v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[A comprehensive study of LLM-based argument classification: from LLAMA through GPT-4o to Deepseek-R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Attacks, and Why? Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., "DevOps Engineer") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLMs Copy to Think: Uncovering Copy-Guided Attacks in Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16773v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to automated code analysis, enabling tasks such as vulnerability detection and code comprehension. However, their integration introduces novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we identify and investigate a new class of prompt-based attacks, termed Copy-Guided Attacks (CGA), which exploit the inherent copying tendencies of reasoning-capable LLMs. By injecting carefully crafted triggers into external code snippets, adversaries can induce the model to replicate malicious content during inference. This behavior enables two classes of vulnerabilities: inference length manipulation, where the model generates abnormally short or excessively long reasoning traces; and inference result manipulation, where the model produces misleading or incorrect conclusions. We formalize CGA as an optimization problem and propose a gradient-based approach to synthesize effective triggers. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs shows that CGA reliably induces infinite loops, premature termination, false refusals, and semantic distortions in code analysis tasks. While highly effective in targeted settings, we observe challenges in generalizing CGA across diverse prompts due to computational constraints, posing an open question for future research. Our findings expose a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in LLM-powered development pipelines and call for urgent advances in prompt-level defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth Gives a False Sense of Privacy: LLM Internal States Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16372v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines, yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025.

| **[ShadowCode: Towards (Automatic) External Prompt Injection Attack against Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v6)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have led to the widespread adoption of code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) for programming tasks. Despite their success in deployment, their security research is left far behind. This paper introduces a new attack paradigm: (automatic) external prompt injection against Code LLMs, where attackers generate concise, non-functional induced perturbations and inject them within a victim's code context. These induced perturbations can be disseminated through commonly used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base), manipulating Code LLMs to achieve malicious objectives during the code completion process. Compared to existing attacks, this method is more realistic and threatening: it does not necessitate control over the model's training process, unlike backdoor attacks, and can achieve specific malicious objectives that are challenging for adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we propose ShadowCode, a simple yet effective method that automatically generates induced perturbations based on code simulation to achieve effective and stealthy external prompt injection. ShadowCode designs its perturbation optimization objectives by simulating realistic code contexts and employs a greedy optimization approach with two enhancement modules: forward reasoning enhancement and keyword-based perturbation design. We evaluate our method across 13 distinct malicious objectives, generating 31 threat cases spanning three popular programming languages. Our results demonstrate that ShadowCode successfully attacks three representative open-source Code LLMs (achieving up to a 97.9% attack success rate) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with over 90% attack success rate) across all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional induced perturbation.

Compared to existing attacks, this method is more realistic and threatening: it does not necessitate control over the model's training process, unlike backdoor attacks, and can achieve specific malicious objectives that are challenging for adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we propose ShadowCode, a simple yet effective method that automatically generates induced perturbations based on code simulation to achieve effective and stealthy external prompt injection. ShadowCode designs its perturbation optimization objectives by simulating realistic code contexts and employs a greedy optimization approach with two enhancement modules: forward reasoning enhancement and keyword-based perturbation design. We evaluate our method across 13 distinct malicious objectives, generating 31 threat cases spanning three popular programming languages. Our results demonstrate that ShadowCode successfully attacks three representative open-source Code LLMs (achieving up to a 97.9% attack success rate) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with over 90% attack success rate) across all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional induced perturbation.

| **[Memorization in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21009v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data, using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events. Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3) Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns at higher ranks. These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large language models while managing data privacy concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large Language Model-Supported Threat Modeling Framework for Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00831v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing threat modeling frameworks related to transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often narrow in scope, labor-intensive, and require substantial cybersecurity expertise. To this end, we introduce the Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling Framework (TraCR-TMF), a large language model (LLM)-based threat modeling framework for transportation CPS that requires limited cybersecurity expert intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and relevant countermeasures for transportation CPS. Three LLM-based approaches support these identifications: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation approach requiring no cybersecurity expert intervention, (ii) an in-context learning approach with low expert intervention, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning approach with moderate expert intervention. TraCR-TMF offers LLM-based attack path identification for critical assets based on vulnerabilities across transportation CPS entities. Additionally, it incorporates the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores of known exploited vulnerabilities to prioritize threat mitigations. The framework was evaluated through two cases. First, the framework identified relevant attack techniques for various transportation CPS applications, 73% of which were validated by cybersecurity experts as correct. Second, the framework was used to identify attack paths for a target asset in a real-world cyberattack incident. TraCR-TMF successfully predicted exploitations, like lateral movement of adversaries, data exfiltration, and data encryption for ransomware, as reported in the incident. These findings show the efficacy of TraCR-TMF in transportation CPS threat modeling, while reducing the need for extensive involvement of cybersecurity experts. To facilitate real-world adoptions, all our codes are shared via an open-source repository.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation datasets heavily lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities, Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse, real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures.

| **[InstructFLIP: Exploring Unified Vision-Language Model for Face Anti-spoofing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12060v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

| **[Accidental Vulnerability: Factors in Fine-Tuning that Shift Model Safeguards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16789v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks emerges as a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate Accidental Vulnerability, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and toxicity across multiple experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial robustness of these fine-tuned models, analyzing persona shifts and interpretability traits to understand how dataset factors contribute to attack success rates. Lastly, we explore causal relationships that offer new insights into adversarial defense strategies, highlighting the crucial role of dataset design in preserving model alignment.

But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming (ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across 19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[More is Less: The Pitfalls of Multi-Model Synthetic Preference Data in DPO Safety Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02193v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is an increasingly critical step in post-training. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updated results and expanded discussion</p></details> |

However, their robustness against adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks, where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open- and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any additional supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Winne...</summary><p>Winner Defender Team at Amazon Nova AI Challenge 2025</p></details> |

PAD introduces Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs. Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size, LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure deployment of diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |

We present PrompTrend, a system that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Hot-Swap MarkBoard: An Efficient Black-box Watermarking Approach for Large-scale Model Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20650v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy. However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP) risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving 100\% verification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
