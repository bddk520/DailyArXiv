This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.</p></details> | Preprint |

We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Rogue Scalpel: Activation Steering Compromises LLM Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22067v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Attacks: Red-teaming LLMs via Adaptive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21947v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/active_attacks}{here}.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[You Can't Steal Nothing: Mitigating Prompt Leakages in LLMs via System Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21884v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across various applications, leveraging customized system prompts for diverse tasks. Facing potential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented strategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their context when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable to new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first introduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks. Our attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based application, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our findings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the problems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose SysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation vectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of unauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities. Remarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the model's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves the LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in long-context scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 tables, 6figures, accepted by CCS 25</p></details> |
| **[Improving LLM Unlearning Robustness via Random Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19202v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here, we show that current state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods inherently reduce models' robustness, causing them to misbehave even when a single non-adversarial forget-token is present in the retain-query. Toward understanding underlying causes, we propose a novel theoretical framework that reframes the unlearning process as backdoor attacks and defenses: forget-tokens act as backdoor triggers that, when activated in retain-queries, cause disruptions in unlearned models' behaviors, similar to successful backdoor attacks. The sense that, LLM unlearning methods themselves poison the model, make it more vulnerable to forget-tokens, and hide rather than erase target knowledge, describes their true mechanism. To mitigate the vulnerability caused by the forgetting process, we reinterpret the retaining process as a backdoor defense and propose Random Noise Augmentation (RNA), a lightweight, model and method-agnostic approach with theoretical guarantees for improving the robustness of models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA significantly improves the robustness of unlearned models while preserving forget and retain performances. This backdoor attack-defense framework offers insights into the mechanism of unlearning that can shed light on future research directions for improving unlearning robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM Generated Reviews of Scientific Publications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10248v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Red Teaming LLM-based Agents with Model Context Protocol Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21011v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLCracker: Exposing the Vulnerability of LLM Watermarks with Adaptive RL Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20924v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) watermarking has shown promise in detecting AI-generated content and mitigating misuse, with prior work claiming robustness against paraphrasing and text editing. In this paper, we argue that existing evaluations are not sufficiently adversarial, obscuring critical vulnerabilities and overstating the security. To address this, we introduce adaptive robustness radius, a formal metric that quantifies watermark resilience against adaptive adversaries. We theoretically prove that optimizing the attack context and model parameters can substantially reduce this radius, making watermarks highly susceptible to paraphrase attacks. Leveraging this insight, we propose RLCracker, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive attack that erases watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity. RLCracker requires only limited watermarked examples and zero access to the detector. Despite weak supervision, it empowers a 3B model to achieve 98.5% removal success and an average 0.92 P-SP score on 1,500-token Unigram-marked texts after training on only 100 short samples. This performance dramatically exceeds 6.75% by GPT-4o and generalizes across five model sizes over ten watermarking schemes. Our results confirm that adaptive attacks are broadly effective and pose a fundamental threat to current watermarking defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. However, the evolving nature of such dynamic dialogues makes it challenging to anticipate emerging vulnerabilities and design effective defenses. To tackle this problem, we present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attack and defense strategies through the simulation of privacy-critical agent interactions. Specifically, we employ LLMs as optimizers to analyze simulation trajectories and iteratively propose new agent instructions. To explore the strategy space more efficiently, we further utilize parallel search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation. Through this process, we find that attack strategies escalate from direct requests to sophisticated tactics, such as impersonation and consent forgery, while defenses evolve from simple rule-based constraints to robust identity-verification state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for building privacy-aware agents.</p></details> | Preprint |

Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings indicate that typographic attacks remain effective against state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models, especially those employing vision encoders inherently vulnerable to such attacks. However, employing larger Large Language Model backbones reduces this vulnerability while simultaneously enhancing typographic understanding. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. Finally, we publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper, along with the code for evaluations under www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop EVAL-FoMo-2</p></details> |

While recent studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models. Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of T2V models.</p></details> |  |

However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot, i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition. We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Adversarial Low-Rank Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15130v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like (Low-Rank Adaptation) LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, to our knowledge the first method designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates training as a minimax optimization over low-rank adapters and adversarial perturbations, enabling robust adaptation with a small trainable footprint. Across eight datasets and two backbones (ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32), AdvCLIP-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot classification, adversarial base-to-new generalization, and cross-dataset transfer, delivering higher adversarial robustness than prompt tuning baselines without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[SCAM: A Real-World Typographic Robustness Evaluation for Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04893v6)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings indicate that typographic attacks remain effective against state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models, especially those employing vision encoders inherently vulnerable to such attacks. However, employing larger Large Language Model backbones reduces this vulnerability while simultaneously enhancing typographic understanding. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. Finally, we publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper, along with the code for evaluations under www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop EVAL-FoMo-2</p></details> |

While recent studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models. Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of T2V models.</p></details> |  |

However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot, i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition. We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

| **[Non-Linear Trajectory Modeling for Multi-Step Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22082v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00472v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference in settings involving complex spatio-temporal dependencies, such as environmental epidemiology, is challenging due to the presence of unmeasured confounding. However, a significant gap persists in existing methods: current diffusion-based causal models rely on restrictive assumptions of causal sufficiency or static confounding. To address this limitation, we introduce the Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model (PFD-BDCM), a generative framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach uniquely incorporates valid backdoor adjustments into the diffusion sampling mechanism to mitigate bias from unmeasured confounders. Specifically, it captures their intricate dynamics through region-specific structural equations and conditional autoregressive processes, and accommodates multi-resolution variables via functional data techniques. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by establishing error bounds for counterfactual estimates. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world air pollution case study confirm that PFD-BDCM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Resource Consumption Red-Teaming for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18053v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have mainly overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap, we propose RECITE ($\textbf{Re}$source $\textbf{C}$onsumpt$\textbf{i}$on Red-$\textbf{Te}$aming for LVLMs), the first approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs red-teaming. First, we present $\textit{Vision Guided Optimization}$, a fine-grained pixel-level optimization to obtain \textit{Output Recall Objective} adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to achieve the goal of RCAs. Empirical results demonstrate that RECITE increases service response latency by over 26 $\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and memory consumption. Our study reveals security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate the development of future defenses against RCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SBFA: Single Sneaky Bit Flip Attack to Break Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21843v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing security concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs' catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats. Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a severe security concern of SOTA LLM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 2 equations.

| **[Towards Minimal Causal Representations for Human Multimodal Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21805v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However, such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation. Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its interpretability and soundness.</p></details> |  |
