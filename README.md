| **[TeleLoRA: Teleporting Model-Specific Alignment Across LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20228v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating Trojans in Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of many tasks where alignment data is LLM specific, as different LLMs have different Trojan triggers and trigger behaviors to be removed. In this paper, we introduce TeleLoRA (Teleporting Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel framework that synergizes model-specific alignment data across multiple LLMs to enable zero-shot Trojan mitigation on unseen LLMs without alignment data. TeleLoRA learns a unified generator of LoRA adapter weights by leveraging local activation information across multiple LLMs. This generator is designed to be permutation symmetric to generalize across models with different architectures and sizes. We optimize the model design for memory efficiency, making it feasible to learn with large-scale LLMs with minimal computational resources. Experiments on LLM Trojan mitigation benchmarks demonstrate that TeleLoRA effectively reduces attack success rates while preserving the benign performance of the models.</p></details> |  |

This study explores LLM-powered location privacy leaks associated with photo sharing on social media, focusing on user awareness, attitudes, and opinions. We developed and introduced an LLM-powered location privacy intervention app to 19 participants, who used it over a two-week period. The app prompted users to reflect on potential privacy leaks that a widely available LLM could easily detect, such as visual landmarks & cues that could reveal their location, and provided ways to conceal this information. Through in-depth interviews, we found that our intervention effectively increased users' awareness of location privacy and the risks posed by LLMs. It also encouraged users to consider the importance of maintaining control over their privacy data and sparked discussions about the future of location privacy-preserving technologies. Based on these insights, we offer design implications to support the development of future user-centred, location privacy-preserving technologies for social media photos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM CHI 2025 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Transfer from LLMs to Provenance Analysis: A Semantic-Augmented Method for APT Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18316v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have caused significant losses across a wide range of sectors, including the theft of sensitive data and harm to system integrity. As attack techniques grow increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, the arms race between cyber defenders and attackers continues to intensify. The revolutionary impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up numerous opportunities in various fields, including cybersecurity. An intriguing question arises: can the extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs be harnessed for provenance analysis and play a positive role in identifying previously unknown malicious events? To seek a deeper understanding of this issue, we propose a new strategy for taking advantage of LLMs in provenance-based threat detection. In our design, the state-of-the-art LLM offers additional details in provenance data interpretation, leveraging their knowledge of system calls, software identity, and high-level understanding of application execution context. The advanced contextualized embedding capability is further utilized to capture the rich semantics of event descriptions. We comprehensively examine the quality of the resulting embeddings, and it turns out that they offer promising avenues. Subsequently, machine learning models built upon these embeddings demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world data. In our evaluation, supervised threat detection achieves a precision of 99.0%, and semi-supervised anomaly detection attains a precision of 96.9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Safety Training of LLMs Generalize to Semantically Related Natural Prompts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03235v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be susceptible to crafted adversarial attacks or jailbreaks that lead to the generation of objectionable content despite being aligned to human preferences using safety fine-tuning methods. While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable to find adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against natural prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 can be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that can jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response Guided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak questions from unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtain attack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on the JailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLM and Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards LLM Unlearning Resilient to Relearning Attacks: A Sharpness-Aware Minimization Perspective and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05374v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The LLM unlearning technique has recently been introduced to comply with data regulations and address the safety and ethical concerns of LLMs by removing the undesired data-model influence. However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

| **[SRMIR: Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18991v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and values is vital for application. However, current alignment methods face three main limitations: (1) reliance on costly human annotation; (2) alignment tax; (3) shallow alignment vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Additionally, current alignment datasets often suffer from uneven distributions, leading to overrepresentation of some topics and neglect of others. To address these issues, we propose SRMIR (Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning), inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. We first construct a balanced safety Chain of Draft (CoD) dataset across $7$ harmful types with structured prompt leveraging the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs, then train a set of specialized reward models to guide policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We apply two strategies, linear combination and categorized approach, to integrate shadow reward models for policy optimization. By comparison, we find that the latter achieves superior alignment despite higher computational costs. Experiments across several LLMs demonstrate SRMIR significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoke and Mirrors: Jailbreaking LLM-based Code Generation via Implicit Malicious Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17953v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing and significantly impacted code generation tasks, enhancing software development efficiency and productivity. Notably, LLMs like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in text-to-code generation tasks. However, the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation necessitates a critical examination of the safety implications associated with their outputs. Existing research efforts have primarily focused on verifying the functional correctness of LLMs, overlooking their safety in code generation. This paper introduces a jailbreaking approach, CodeJailbreaker, designed to uncover safety concerns in LLM-based code generation. The basic observation is that existing safety mechanisms for LLMs are built through the instruction-following paradigm, where malicious intent is explicitly articulated within the instruction of the prompt. Consequently, CodeJailbreaker explores to construct a prompt whose instruction is benign and the malicious intent is implicitly encoded in a covert channel, i.e., the commit message, to bypass the safety mechanism. Experiments on the recently-released RMCBench benchmark demonstrate that CodeJailbreaker markedly surpasses the conventional jailbreaking strategy, which explicitly conveys malicious intents in the instructions, in terms of the attack effectiveness across three code generation tasks. This study challenges the traditional safety paradigms in LLM-based code generation, emphasizing the need for enhanced safety measures in safeguarding against implicit malicious cues.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATA: A Paradigm for LLM Jailbreak via Simple Assistive Task Linkage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15289v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, but their safety alignment remain a major concern. Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, they also introduce privacy concerns: firstly, numerous studies underscore the risks to user privacy posed by jailbreaking cloud-based LLMs; secondly, the LLM service providers have access to all user data, which deters individuals from confidently utilizing such services. To address such concerns, we propose a simple yet effective paradigm, EmojiPrompt, to protect user privacy. At its core, EmojiPrompt performs generative transformation, obfuscating private data within prompts with linguistic and non-linguistic elements before submitting them to cloud-based LLMs. We evaluate EmojiPrompt's performance across 8 datasets from various domains. We also propose simulated inference attacks to assess EmojiPrompt's ability to preserve user privacy. The results demonstrate that EmojiPrompt effectively obfuscates user private data, while largely maintaining, or even enhancing, performances compared to the unobfuscated version. Furthermore, EmojiPrompt's atomic-level obfuscation allows it to function exclusively with cloud-based LLMs. For source code, please refer to: https://github.com/agiresearch/EmojiCrypt.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Robust LLM safeguarding via refusal feature adversarial training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20089v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can elicit harmful responses. Defending against such attacks remains challenging due to the opacity of jailbreaking mechanisms and the high computational cost of training LLMs robustly. We demonstrate that adversarial attacks share a universal mechanism for circumventing LLM safeguards that works by ablating a dimension in the residual stream embedding space called the refusal feature. We further show that the operation of refusal feature ablation (RFA) approximates the worst-case perturbation of offsetting model safety. Based on these findings, we propose Refusal Feature Adversarial Training (ReFAT), a novel algorithm that efficiently performs LLM adversarial training by simulating the effect of input-level attacks via RFA. Experiment results show that ReFAT significantly improves the robustness of three popular LLMs against a wide range of adversarial attacks, with considerably less computational overhead compared to existing adversarial training methods.</p></details> |  |

Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables, to be published in The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (CVPR)</p></details> |
| **[The importance of the clustering model to detect new types of intrusion in data traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14550v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current digital age, the volume of data generated by various cyber activities has become enormous and is constantly increasing. The data may contain valuable insights that can be harnessed to improve cyber security measures. However, much of this data is unclassified and qualitative, which poses significant challenges to traditional analysis methods. Clustering facilitates the identification of hidden patterns and structures in data through grouping similar data points, which makes it simpler to identify and address threats. Clustering can be defined as a data mining (DM) approach, which uses similarity calculations for dividing a data set into several categories. Hierarchical, density-based, along with partitioning clustering algorithms are typical. The presented work use K-means algorithm, which is a popular clustering technique. Utilizing K-means algorithm, we worked with two different types of data: first, we gathered data with the use of XG-boost algorithm following completing the aggregation with K-means algorithm. Data was gathered utilizing Kali Linux environment, cicflowmeter traffic, and Putty Software tools with the use of diverse and simple attacks. The concept could assist in identifying new attack types, which are distinct from the known attacks, and labeling them based on the characteristics they will exhibit, as the dynamic nature regarding cyber threats means that new attack types often emerge, for which labeled data might not yet exist. The model counted the attacks and assigned numbers to each one of them. Secondly, We tried the same work on the ready data inside the Kaggle repository called (Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things Network), and the clustering model worked well and detected the number of attacks correctly as shown in the results section.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Preference Optimization (PO) methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to align generative models with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using different PO methods to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks and inductive biases, commonly seen in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks.

This study exploits LLMs with an iterative prompting technique where each prompt is systematically modified and refined across multiple iterations to enhance its effectiveness in jailbreaking attacks progressively. This technique involves analyzing the response patterns of LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, allowing us to adjust and optimize prompts to evade the LLMs' ethical and security constraints. Persuasion strategies enhance prompt effectiveness while maintaining consistency with malicious intent. Our results show that the attack success rates (ASR) increase as the attacking prompts become more refined with the highest ASR of 90% for GPT4 and ChatGLM and the lowest ASR of 68% for LLaMa2. Our technique outperforms baseline techniques (PAIR and PAP) in ASR and shows comparable performance with GCG and ArtPrompt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stealthy Backdoor Attack in Self-Supervised Learning Vision Encoders for Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18290v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) vision encoders learn high-quality image representations and thus have become a vital part of developing vision modality of large vision language models (LVLMs). Due to the high cost of training such encoders, pre-trained encoders are widely shared and deployed into many LVLMs, which are security-critical or bear societal significance. Under this practical scenario, we reveal a new backdoor threat that significant visual hallucinations can be induced into these LVLMs by merely compromising vision encoders. Because of the sharing and reuse of these encoders, many downstream LVLMs may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders, leading to widespread backdoors. In this work, we propose BadVision, the first method to exploit this vulnerability in SSL vision encoders for LVLMs with novel trigger optimization and backdoor learning techniques. We evaluate BadVision on two types of SSL encoders and LVLMs across eight benchmarks. We show that BadVision effectively drives the LVLMs to attacker-chosen hallucination with over 99% attack success rate, causing a 77.6% relative visual understanding error while maintaining the stealthiness. SoTA backdoor detection methods cannot detect our attack effectively.</p></details> |  |

These vulnerabilities have been actively targeted in real-world attacks, causing substantial harm to users and cyberinfrastructure. Since many of these flaws originate from the code itself, a variety of techniques have been proposed to detect and mitigate them prior to software deployment. However, a comprehensive comparative study that spans different programming languages, program representations, bug types, and analysis techniques is still lacking. As a result, the relationships among programming languages, abstraction levels, vulnerability types, and detection approaches remain fragmented, and the limitations and research gaps across the landscape are not clearly understood. This article aims to bridge that gap by systematically examining widely used programming languages, levels of program representation, categories of vulnerabilities, and mainstream detection techniques. The survey provides a detailed understanding of current practices in vulnerability discovery, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and distinguishing characteristics. Furthermore, it identifies persistent challenges and outlines promising directions for future research in the field of software security.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TeleLoRA (Teleporting Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel framework that synergizes model-specific alignment data across multiple LLMs to enable zero-shot Trojan mitigation on unseen LLMs without alignment data. TeleLoRA learns a unified generator of LoRA adapter weights by leveraging local activation information across multiple LLMs. This generator is designed to be permutation symmetric to generalize across models with different architectures and sizes. We optimize the model design for memory efficiency, making it feasible to learn with large-scale LLMs with minimal computational resources. Experiments on LLM Trojan mitigation benchmarks demonstrate that TeleLoRA effectively reduces attack success rates while preserving the benign performance of the models.</p></details> |  |

However, terror attack data from the Global Terrorism Database is reported as total event counts in disjoint observation periods, with precise event times unknown. When the MHP is only observed discretely, the likelihood function becomes intractable, hindering likelihood-based inference. To address this, we design an unbiased estimate of the intractable likelihood function using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) based on a representation of the unobserved event times as latent variables in a state-space model. The unbiasedness of the SMC estimate allows for its use in place of the true likelihood in a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, from which we construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sample of the distribution over the parameters of the MHP. Using simulated data, we assess the performance of our method and demonstrate that it outperforms an alternative method in the literature based on mean squared error. Terrorist activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan from 2018 to 2021 is analysed based on daily count data to examine the self- and cross-excitation effects of terrorism events.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 13 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Adversarial Threat Models in Cyber Physical Battery Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13801v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Technological advancements like the Internet of Things (IoT) have facilitated data exchange across various platforms. This data exchange across various platforms has transformed the traditional battery system into a cyber physical system. Such connectivity makes modern cyber physical battery systems vulnerable to cyber threats where a cyber attacker can manipulate sensing and actuation signals to bring the battery system into an unsafe operating condition. Hence, it is essential to build resilience in modern cyber physical battery systems (CPBS) under cyber attacks. The first step of building such resilience is to analyze potential adversarial behavior, that is, how the adversaries can inject attacks into the battery systems. However, it has been found that in this under-explored area of battery cyber physical security, such an adversarial threat model has not been studied in a systematic manner. In this study, we address this gap and explore adversarial attack generation policies based on optimal control framework. The framework is developed by performing theoretical analysis, which is subsequently supported by evaluation with experimental data generated from a commercial battery cell.</p></details> |  |

With advancements in vision-language pretrained (VLP) models, recent two-class FAS techniques have leveraged the advantages of using VLP guidance, while this potential remains unexplored in one-class FAS methods. The one-class FAS focuses on learning intrinsic liveness features solely from live training images to differentiate between live and spoof faces. However, the lack of spoof training data can lead one-class FAS models to inadvertently incorporate domain information irrelevant to the live/spoof distinction (e.g., facial content), causing performance degradation when tested with a new application domain. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Spoof-aware one-class face anti-spoofing with Language Image Pretraining (SLIP). Given that live faces should ideally not be obscured by any spoof-attack-related objects (e.g., paper, or masks) and are assumed to yield zero spoof cue maps, we first propose an effective language-guided spoof cue map estimation to enhance one-class FAS models by simulating whether the underlying faces are covered by attack-related objects and generating corresponding nonzero spoof cue maps. Next, we introduce a novel prompt-driven liveness feature disentanglement to alleviate live/spoof-irrelative domain variations by disentangling live/spoof-relevant and domain-dependent information. Finally, we design an effective augmentation strategy by fusing latent features from live images and spoof prompts to generate spoof-like image features and thus diversify latent spoof features to facilitate the learning of one-class FAS. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies support that SLIP consistently outperforms previous one-class FAS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables, to be published in The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (CVPR)</p></details> |
| **[The importance of the clustering model to detect new types of intrusion in data traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14550v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current digital age, the volume of data generated by various cyber activities has become enormous and is constantly increasing. The data may contain valuable insights that can be harnessed to improve cyber security measures. However, much of this data is unclassified and qualitative, which poses significant challenges to traditional analysis methods. Clustering facilitates the identification of hidden patterns and structures in data through grouping similar data points, which makes it simpler to identify and address threats. Clustering can be defined as a data mining (DM) approach, which uses similarity calculations for dividing a data set into several categories. Hierarchical, density-based, along with partitioning clustering algorithms are typical. The presented work use K-means algorithm, which is a popular clustering technique. Utilizing K-means algorithm, we worked with two different types of data: first, we gathered data with the use of XG-boost algorithm following completing the aggregation with K-means algorithm. Data was gathered utilizing Kali Linux environment, cicflowmeter traffic, and Putty Software tools with the use of diverse and simple attacks. The concept could assist in identifying new attack types, which are distinct from the known attacks, and labeling them based on the characteristics they will exhibit, as the dynamic nature regarding cyber threats means that new attack types often emerge, for which labeled data might not yet exist. The model counted the attacks and assigned numbers to each one of them. Secondly, We tried the same work on the ready data inside the Kaggle repository called (Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things Network), and the clustering model worked well and detected the number of attacks correctly as shown in the results section.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Preference Optimization (PO) methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to align generative models with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using different PO methods to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks and inductive biases, commonly seen in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks requiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We evaluate our method for tackling typographic attacks on images and explore its ability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the versatility of our approach.</p></details> |  |
