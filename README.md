| **[Benchmarking Practices in LLM-driven Offensive Security: Testbeds, Metrics, and Experiment Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10112v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for driving offensive penetration-testing tooling. Due to the opaque nature of LLMs, empirical methods are typically used to analyze their efficacy. The quality of this analysis is highly dependent on the chosen testbed, captured metrics and analysis methods employed. This paper analyzes the methodology and benchmarking practices used for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven attacks, focusing on offensive uses of LLMs in cybersecurity. We review 19 research papers detailing 18 prototypes and their respective testbeds. We detail our findings and provide actionable recommendations for future research, emphasizing the importance of extending existing testbeds, creating baselines, and including comprehensive metrics and qualitative analysis. We also note the distinction between security research and practice, suggesting that CTF-based challenges may not fully represent real-world penetration testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Promise to Peril: Rethinking Cybersecurity Red and Blue Teaming in the Age of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13434v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are set to reshape cybersecurity by augmenting red and blue team operations. Red teams can exploit LLMs to plan attacks, craft phishing content, simulate adversaries, and generate exploit code. Conversely, blue teams may deploy them for threat intelligence synthesis, root cause analysis, and streamlined documentation. This dual capability introduces both transformative potential and serious risks. This position paper maps LLM applications across cybersecurity frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), offering a structured view of their current utility and limitations. While LLMs demonstrate fluency and versatility across various tasks, they remain fragile in high-stakes, context-heavy environments. Key limitations include hallucinations, limited context retention, poor reasoning, and sensitivity to prompts, which undermine their reliability in operational settings. Moreover, real-world integration raises concerns around dual-use risks, adversarial misuse, and diminished human oversight. Malicious actors could exploit LLMs to automate reconnaissance, obscure attack vectors, and lower the technical threshold for executing sophisticated attacks. To ensure safer adoption, we recommend maintaining human-in-the-loop oversight, enhancing model explainability, integrating privacy-preserving mechanisms, and building systems robust to adversarial exploitation. As organizations increasingly adopt AI driven cybersecurity, a nuanced understanding of LLMs' risks and operational impacts is critical to securing their defensive value while mitigating unintended consequences.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Mitigating Safety Fallback in Editing-based Backdoor Injection on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13285v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language tasks, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Recent model editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses. However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety alignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal responses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1) Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited model to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors, reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets. Experiments on safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\% and reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\% over baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Black Box: Leveraging LLMs for Effective Text-Level Graph Injection Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13276v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrate textual data with graph structures, providing valuable insights in applications such as social network analysis and recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture both topological structure and textual information in TAGs but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing graph injection attack (GIA) methods assume that attackers can directly manipulate the embedding layer, producing non-explainable node embeddings. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these attacks often relies on surrogate models with high training costs. Thus, this paper introduces ATAG-LLM, a novel black-box GIA framework tailored for TAGs. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable text-level node attributes directly, ensuring attacks remain feasible in real-world scenarios. We design strategies for LLM prompting that balance exploration and reliability to guide text generation, and propose a similarity assessment method to evaluate attack text effectiveness in disrupting graph homophily. This method efficiently perturbs the target node with minimal training costs in a strict black-box setting, ensuring a text-level graph injection attack for TAGs. Experiments on real-world TAG datasets validate the superior performance of ATAG-LLM compared to state-of-the-art embedding-level and text-level attack methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Hard-Coded Credentials in Software Repositories via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13090v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software developers frequently hard-code credentials such as passwords, generic secrets, private keys, and generic tokens in software repositories, even though it is strictly advised against due to the severe threat to the security of the software. These credentials create attack surfaces exploitable by a potential adversary to conduct malicious exploits such as backdoor attacks. Recent detection efforts utilize embedding models to vectorize textual credentials before passing them to classifiers for predictions. However, these models struggle to discriminate between credentials with contextual and complex sequences resulting in high false positive predictions. Context-dependent Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) or Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) tackled this drawback by leveraging the transformer neural architecture capacity for self-attention to capture contextual dependencies between words in input sequences. As a result, GPT has achieved wide success in several natural language understanding endeavors. Hence, we assess LLMs to represent these observations and feed extracted embedding vectors to a deep learning classifier to detect hard-coded credentials. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 13% in F1 measure on the benchmark dataset. We have made all source code and data publicly available to facilitate the reproduction of all results presented in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACM Digital Threats: Research and Practice (DTRAP)</p></details> |
| **[Speak Easy: Eliciting Harmful Jailbreaks from LLMs with Simple Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04322v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Infer Confidential Properties of Training Data from LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10364v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence -- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models) and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms: question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SecurityLingua: Efficient Defense of LLM Jailbreak Attacks via Security-Aware Prompt Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12707v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption across numerous applications. However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks even after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety guardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial jailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial training and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but these methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant computational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose SecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we train a prompt compressor designed to discern the "true intention" of the input prompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of adversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is passed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true intention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience by leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's potentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails of the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only a negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense methods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense. Experimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend against malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible compute and latency overhead. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/SecurityLingua.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alphabet Index Mapping: Jailbreaking LLMs through Semantic Dissimilarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12685v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreaking, poses significant safety and ethical concerns. While numerous jailbreak methods exist, many suffer from computational expense, high token usage, or complex decoding schemes. Liu et al. (2024) introduced FlipAttack, a black-box method that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) through simple prompt manipulation. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of FlipAttack's effectiveness by analyzing the semantic changes induced by its flipping modes. We hypothesize that semantic dissimilarity between original and manipulated prompts is inversely correlated with ASR. To test this, we examine embedding space visualizations (UMAP, KDE) and cosine similarities for FlipAttack's modes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack, Alphabet Index Mapping (AIM), designed to maximize semantic dissimilarity while maintaining simple decodability. Experiments on GPT-4 using a subset of AdvBench show AIM and its variant AIM+FWO achieve a 94% ASR, outperforming FlipAttack and other methods on this subset. Our findings suggest that while high semantic dissimilarity is crucial, a balance with decoding simplicity is key for successful jailbreaking. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of adversarial prompt mechanics and offers a new, effective jailbreak technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Monitoring Decomposition Attacks in LLMs with Lightweight Sequential Monitors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10949v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent, leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87% attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents. To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate, beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection, Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13746v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the interpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks. However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions, using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy, whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning models are more or less vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks than their non-reasoning counterparts. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of weaknesses in advanced reasoning models compared to similar non-reasoning models across a diverse set of prompt-based attack categories. Using experimental data, we find that on average the reasoning-augmented models are \emph{slightly more robust} than non-reasoning models (42.51\% vs 45.53\% attack success rate, lower is better). However, this overall trend masks significant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the reasoning models are substantially \emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32 percentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are markedly \emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting injection). Our findings highlight the nuanced security implications of advanced reasoning in language models and emphasize the importance of stress-testing safety across diverse adversarial techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to LLMSEC 2025</p></details> |

It is nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing) particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically.

| **[CAT: Contrastive Adversarial Training for Evaluating the Robustness of Protective Perturbations in Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07225v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in many downstream image synthesis tasks. However, customization of latent diffusion models using unauthorized data can severely compromise the privacy and intellectual property rights of data owners. Adversarial examples as protective perturbations have been developed to defend against unauthorized data usage by introducing imperceptible noise to customization samples, preventing diffusion models from effectively learning them. In this paper, we first reveal that the primary reason adversarial examples are effective as protective perturbations in latent diffusion models is the distortion of their latent representations, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments. We then propose the Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT) utilizing lightweight adapters as an adaptive attack against these protection methods, highlighting their lack of robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CAT method significantly reduces the effectiveness of protective perturbations in customization, urging the community to reconsider and improve the robustness of existing protective perturbations.

| **[Jailbreak Strength and Model Similarity Predict Transferability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12913v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaks pose an imminent threat to ensuring the safety of modern AI systems by enabling users to disable safeguards and elicit unsafe information. Sometimes, jailbreaks discovered for one model incidentally transfer to another model, exposing a fundamental flaw in safeguarding. Unfortunately, there is no principled approach to identify when jailbreaks will transfer from a source model to a target model. In this work, we observe that transfer success from a source model to a target model depends on quantifiable measures of both jailbreak strength with respect to the source model and the contextual representation similarity of the two models. Furthermore, we show transferability can be increased by distilling from the target model into the source model where the only target model responses used to train the source model are those to benign prompts. We show that the distilled source model can act as a surrogate for the target model, yielding more transferable attacks against the target model. These results suggest that the success of jailbreaks is not merely due to exploitation of safety training failing to generalize out-of-distribution, but instead a consequence of a more fundamental flaw in contextual representations computed by models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrojanTO: Action-Level Backdoor Attacks against Trajectory Optimization Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12815v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Trajectory Optimization (TO) models have achieved remarkable success in offline reinforcement learning. However, their vulnerabilities against backdoor attacks are poorly understood. We find that existing backdoor attacks in reinforcement learning are based on reward manipulation, which are largely ineffective against the TO model due to its inherent sequence modeling nature. Moreover, the complexities introduced by high-dimensional action spaces further compound the challenge of action manipulation. To address these gaps, we propose TrojanTO, the first action-level backdoor attack against TO models. TrojanTO employs alternating training to enhance the connection between triggers and target actions for attack effectiveness. To improve attack stealth, it utilizes precise poisoning via trajectory filtering for normal performance and batch poisoning for trigger consistency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TrojanTO effectively implants backdoor attacks across diverse tasks and attack objectives with a low attack budget (0.3\% of trajectories). Furthermore, TrojanTO exhibits broad applicability to DT, GDT, and DC, underscoring its scalability across diverse TO model architectures.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege. We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in January 22, 2025, revised under shepherding</p></details> |

Despite their effectiveness, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In order to enhance model resilience against such challenges, Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a prominent solution. Nevertheless, adversarial robustness is often attained at the expense of model fairness during AT, i.e., disparity in class-wise robustness of the model. While distinctive classes become more robust towards such adversaries, hard to detect classes suffer. Recently, research has focused on improving model fairness specifically for perturbed images, overlooking the accuracy of the most likely non-perturbed data. Additionally, despite their robustness against the adversaries encountered during model training, state-of-the-art adversarial trained models have difficulty maintaining robustness and fairness when confronted with diverse adversarial threats or common corruptions. In this work, we address the above concerns by introducing a novel approach called Fair Targeted Adversarial Training (FAIR-TAT). We show that using targeted adversarial attacks for adversarial training (instead of untargeted attacks) can allow for more favorable trade-offs with respect to adversarial fairness. Empirical results validate the efficacy of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Although backdoor-based fingerprinting has emerged as a promising solution for model authentication, effective attacks for removing these fingerprints remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we present Mismatched Eraser (MEraser), a novel method for effectively removing backdoor-based fingerprints from LLMs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples. Furthermore, we introduce a transferable erasure mechanism that enables effective fingerprinting removal across different models without repeated training. In conclusion, our approach provides a practical solution for fingerprinting removal in LLMs, reveals critical vulnerabilities in current fingerprinting techniques, and establishes comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for developing more resilient model protection methods in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025, Main Conference, Long Paper</p></details> |

| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection, Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13746v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the interpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks. However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions, using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy, whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakest Link in the Chain: Security Vulnerabilities in Advanced Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13726v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of advanced reasoning capabilities have improved the problem-solving performance of large language models, particularly on math and coding benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these reasoning models are more or less vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks than their non-reasoning counterparts. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of weaknesses in advanced reasoning models compared to similar non-reasoning models across a diverse set of prompt-based attack categories. Using experimental data, we find that on average the reasoning-augmented models are \emph{slightly more robust} than non-reasoning models (42.51\% vs 45.53\% attack success rate, lower is better). However, this overall trend masks significant category-specific differences: for certain attack types the reasoning models are substantially \emph{more vulnerable} (e.g., up to 32 percentage points worse on a tree-of-attacks prompt), while for others they are markedly \emph{more robust} (e.g., 29.8 points better on cross-site scripting injection). Our findings highlight the nuanced security implications of advanced reasoning in language models and emphasize the importance of stress-testing safety across diverse adversarial techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to LLMSEC 2025</p></details> |
| **[When Detection Fails: The Power of Fine-Tuned Models to Generate Human-Like Social Media Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09975v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing) particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally applicable and realistic LLM use case.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in ACL Findings</p></details> |

We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment. Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.</p></details> |  |
