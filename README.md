| **[RAGRank: Using PageRank to Counter Poisoning in CTI LLM Pipelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20768v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Bad Tokens: Detoxification of LLMs Using Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14536v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications, yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity, vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[PhantomLint: Principled Detection of Hidden LLM Prompts in Structured Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17884v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hidden LLM prompts have appeared in online documents with increasing frequency. Their goal is to trigger indirect prompt injection attacks while remaining undetected from human oversight, to manipulate LLM-powered automated document processing systems, against applications as diverse as r\'esum\'e screeners through to academic peer review processes. Detecting hidden LLM prompts is therefore important for ensuring trust in AI-assisted human decision making. This paper presents the first principled approach to hidden LLM prompt detection in structured documents. We implement our approach in a prototype tool called PhantomLint. We evaluate PhantomLint against a corpus of 3,402 documents, including both PDF and HTML documents, and covering academic paper preprints, CVs, theses and more. We find that our approach is generally applicable against a wide range of methods for hiding LLM prompts from visual inspection, has a very low false positive rate (approx. 0.092%), is practically useful for detecting hidden LLM prompts in real documents, while achieving acceptable performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Self-Tuning LLMs for Enhanced Jailbreaking Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18469v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.

| **[Lexo: Eliminating Stealthy Supply-Chain Attacks via LLM-Assisted Program Regeneration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14522v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software supply-chain attacks are an important and ongoing concern in the open source software ecosystem. These attacks maintain the standard functionality that a component implements, but additionally hide malicious functionality activated only when the component reaches its target environment. Lexo addresses such stealthy attacks by automatically learning and regenerating vulnerability-free versions of potentially malicious components. Lexo first generates a set of input-output pairs to model a component's full observable behavior, which it then uses to synthesize a new version of the original component. The new component implements the original functionality but avoids stealthy malicious behavior. Throughout this regeneration process, Lexo consults several distinct instances of Large Language Models (LLMs), uses correctness and coverage metrics to shepherd these instances, and guardrails their results. Our evaluation on 100+ real-world packages, including high profile stealthy supply-chain attacks, indicates that Lexo scales across multiple domains, regenerates code efficiently (<100s on average), maintains compatibility, and succeeds in eliminating malicious code in several real-world supply-chain-attacks, even in cases when a state-of-the-art LLM fails to eliminate malicious code when prompted to do so.</p></details> |  |
| **[AegisMCP: Online Graph Intrusion Detection for Tool-Augmented LLMs on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19462v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study security of Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent toolchains and their applications in smart homes. We introduce AegisMCP, a protocol-level intrusion detector. Our contributions are: (i) a minimal attack suite spanning instruction-driven escalation, chain-of-tool exfiltration, malicious MCP server registration, and persistence; (ii) NEBULA-Schema (Network-Edge Behavioral Learning for Untrusted LLM Agents), a reusable protocol-level instrumentation that represents MCP activity as a streaming heterogeneous temporal graph over agents, MCP servers, tools, devices, remotes, and sessions; and (iii) a CPU-only streaming detector that fuses novelty, session-DAG structure, and attribute cues for near-real-time edge inference, with optional fusion of local prompt-guardrail signals. On an emulated smart-home testbed spanning multiple MCP stacks and a physical bench, AegisMCP achieves sub-second per-window model inference and end-to-end alerting. The latency of AegisMCP is consistently sub-second on Intel N150-class edge hardware, while outperforming traffic-only and sequence baselines; ablations confirm the importance of DAG and install/permission signals. We release code, schemas, and generators for reproducible evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems Against Corruptions via Node Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19420v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have become a popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChengcanWu/Monitoring-LLM-Based-Multi-Agent-Systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAPRAD: LLM-Assisted PRotocol Attack Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19264v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be hard to detect. LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM (GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation). Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and effectiveness. Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to produce a similar effect. These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush, circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>IFIP ...</summary><p>IFIP Networking 2025 Proceedings (Accepted on 05.05.2025)</p></details> |
| **[NEXUS: Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences in Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03417v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially multi-turn jailbreaks that distribute malicious intent across benign exchanges and bypass alignment mechanisms. Existing approaches often explore the adversarial space poorly, rely on hand-crafted heuristics, or lack systematic query refinement. We present NEXUS (Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences), a modular framework for constructing, refining, and executing optimized multi-turn attacks. NEXUS comprises: (1) ThoughtNet, which hierarchically expands a harmful intent into a structured semantic network of topics, entities, and query chains; (2) a feedback-driven Simulator that iteratively refines and prunes these chains through attacker-victim-judge LLM collaboration using harmfulness and semantic-similarity benchmarks; and (3) a Network Traverser that adaptively navigates the refined query space for real-time attacks. This pipeline uncovers stealthy, high-success adversarial paths across LLMs. On several closed-source and open-source LLMs, NEXUS increases attack success rate by 2.1% to 19.4% over prior methods.

We present DeepTx, a real-time transaction analysis system that detects such threats before user confirmation. DeepTx simulates pending transactions, extracts behavior, context, and UI features, and uses multiple large language models (LLMs) to reason about transaction intent. A consensus mechanism with self-reflection ensures robust and explainable decisions. Evaluated on our phishing dataset, DeepTx achieves high precision and recall (demo video: https://youtu.be/4OfK9KCEXUM).</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |

While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

In particular, explainability techniques, such as counterfactual explanations, inadvertently increase the risk of model extraction attacks, enabling unauthorized replication of proprietary models. In this paper, we formalize and characterize the risks and inherent complexity of model reconstruction, focusing on the "oracle'' queries required for faithfully inferring the underlying prediction function. We present the first formal analysis of model extraction attacks through the lens of competitive analysis, establishing a foundational framework to evaluate their efficiency. Focusing on models based on additive decision trees (e.g., decision trees, gradient boosting, and random forests), we introduce novel reconstruction algorithms that achieve provably perfect fidelity while demonstrating strong anytime performance. Our framework provides theoretical bounds on the query complexity for extracting tree-based model, offering new insights into the security vulnerabilities of their deployment.</p></details> |  |

With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks, questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and further resources are publicly available.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics.

We present a systematic study of multimodal jailbreaks targeting both vision-language and audio-language models, showing that even simple perceptual transformations can reliably bypass state-of-the-art safety filters. Our evaluation spans 1,900 adversarial prompts across three high-risk safety categories harmful content, CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear), and CSEM (Child Sexual Exploitation Material) tested against seven frontier models. We explore the effectiveness of attack techniques on MLLMs, including FigStep-Pro (visual keyword decomposition), Intelligent Masking (semantic obfuscation), and audio perturbations (Wave-Echo, Wave-Pitch, Wave-Speed). The results reveal severe vulnerabilities: models with almost perfect text-only safety (0\% ASR) suffer >75\% attack success under perceptually modified inputs, with FigStep-Pro achieving up to 89\% ASR in Llama-4 variants. Audio-based attacks further uncover provider-specific weaknesses, with even basic modality transfer yielding 25\% ASR for technical queries. These findings expose a critical gap between text-centric alignment and multimodal threats, demonstrating that current safeguards fail to generalize across cross-modal attacks. The accessibility of these attacks, which require minimal technical expertise, suggests that robust multimodal AI safety will require a paradigm shift toward broader semantic-level reasoning to mitigate possible risks.</p></details> |  |

Existing auditing methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure, prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4) Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math, medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and trustworthy LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing defense strategies rely on external interventions, such as input filtering or output modification, which often lack generalizability and compromise model utility while incurring significant computational overhead. In this work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating Internal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external correction to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's own reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent through a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract core semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety awareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust decision-making. Extensive experiments on five open-source LLMs against six advanced jailbreak attacks demonstrate that SAID substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in reducing harmful outputs. Crucially, it achieves this while preserving model performance on benign tasks and incurring minimal computational overhead. Our work establishes that activating the intrinsic safety mechanisms of LLMs is a more robust and scalable path toward building safer and more reliable aligned AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, potential misuse or safety alignment concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation (JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms for VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the performance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a challenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance execution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate privacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to untrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts an information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy: security-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of attention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an SGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are performed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the enclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and evaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that SecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance, offering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Intelligent Computing and Systems at the Edge (ICEdge) 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Tail Tells All: Estimating Model-Level Membership Inference Vulnerability Without Reference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19773v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models, limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region) of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.</p></details> |  |

| **[BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

In particular, explainability techniques, such as counterfactual explanations, inadvertently increase the risk of model extraction attacks, enabling unauthorized replication of proprietary models. In this paper, we formalize and characterize the risks and inherent complexity of model reconstruction, focusing on the "oracle'' queries required for faithfully inferring the underlying prediction function. We present the first formal analysis of model extraction attacks through the lens of competitive analysis, establishing a foundational framework to evaluate their efficiency. Focusing on models based on additive decision trees (e.g., decision trees, gradient boosting, and random forests), we introduce novel reconstruction algorithms that achieve provably perfect fidelity while demonstrating strong anytime performance. Our framework provides theoretical bounds on the query complexity for extracting tree-based model, offering new insights into the security vulnerabilities of their deployment.</p></details> |  |

With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks, questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and further resources are publicly available.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
