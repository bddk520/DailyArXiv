These attacks manipulate LLMs to generate harmful or unethical content by crafting adversarial prompts. While much of the current research on jailbreak attacks has focused on single-turn interactions, it has largely overlooked the impact of historical dialogues on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak paradigm, Dialogue Injection Attack (DIA), which leverages the dialogue history to enhance the success rates of such attacks. DIA operates in a black-box setting, requiring only access to the chat API or knowledge of the LLM's chat template. We propose two methods for constructing adversarial historical dialogues: one adapts gray-box prefilling attacks, and the other exploits deferred responses. Our experiments show that DIA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent LLMs, including Llama-3.1 and GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate that DIA can bypass 5 different defense mechanisms, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[MAGIC: Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation in Context through Collaborative LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08014v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models. However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world environments and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate deployment within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and generates adversarial patch through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. In particular, MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal deployment strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical levels, i.e., nuImage and manually captured real-world scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effective for attacking widely applied object detection systems, i.e., YOLO and DETR series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Guardrails for LLM-Enabled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07885v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety concerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to adversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in real-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the novel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the physical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure the safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined safety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust LLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety specifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves potential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a possibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures safety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking attacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans from 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also demonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive attacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to perform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to mitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11934v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Data Contamination Detection Work (Well) for LLMs? A Survey and Evaluation on Detection Assumptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18966v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance across various benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However, as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern in their evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data and evaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. Multiple approaches have been developed to identify data contamination. These approaches rely on specific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings. To bridge this gap, we systematically review 50 papers on data contamination detection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they have been rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories of assumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our case studies focus on detecting direct, instance-level data contamination, which is also referred to as Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). Our analysis reveals that MIA approaches based on these three assumptions can have similar performance to random guessing, on datasets used in LLM pretraining, suggesting that current LLMs might learn data distributions rather than memorizing individual instances. Meanwhile, MIA can easily fail when there are data distribution shifts between the seen and unseen instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables and 1 figures in the main text.

| **[MAD-MAX: Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures for Automated LLM Red Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06253v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With LLM usage rapidly increasing, their vulnerability to jailbreaks that create harmful outputs are a major security risk. As new jailbreaking strategies emerge and models are changed by fine-tuning, continuous testing for security vulnerabilities is necessary. Existing Red Teaming methods fall short in cost efficiency, attack success rate, attack diversity, or extensibility as new attack types emerge. We address these challenges with Modular And Diverse Malicious Attack MiXtures (MAD-MAX) for Automated LLM Red Teaming. MAD-MAX uses automatic assignment of attack strategies into relevant attack clusters, chooses the most relevant clusters for a malicious goal, and then combines strategies from the selected clusters to achieve diverse novel attacks with high attack success rates. MAD-MAX further merges promising attacks together at each iteration of Red Teaming to boost performance and introduces a similarity filter to prune out similar attacks for increased cost efficiency. The MAD-MAX approach is designed to be easily extensible with newly discovered attack strategies and outperforms the prominent Red Teaming method Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) significantly in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) and queries needed to achieve jailbreaks. MAD-MAX jailbreaks 97% of malicious goals in our benchmarks on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro compared to TAP with 66%. MAD-MAX does so with only 10.9 average queries to the target LLM compared to TAP with 23.3. WARNING: This paper contains contents which are offensive in nature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Security Bench (ASB): Formalizing and Benchmarking Attacks and Defenses in LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02644v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security. Our code can be found at https://github.com/agiresearch/ASB.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs are Rushing Nowhere (and How to Fix It)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17975v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whether LLMs memorize their training data and what this means, from measuring privacy leakage to detecting copyright violations, has become a rapidly growing area of research. In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these methods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization raises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In this work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and show that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are considered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in the literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all datasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These shifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world scenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent papers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. We introduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in turn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized (unique) sequences, randomized fine-tuning, and several post-hoc control methods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we believe they collectively provide solid grounds to guide MIA development and study LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches to benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML 2025)</p></details> |

Exploring SQL Injection via Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art results in translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL), a long-standing challenge within the database community. However, security concerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor attacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through fine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a novel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and character-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove, ensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model accuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection payloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet executable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in language model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44% of poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a significant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and mitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the urgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the importance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.</p></details> |  |

With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors.

Although efforts have been made to protect PII in LLMs, existing methods struggle to balance privacy protection with maintaining model utility. In this paper, inspired by studies of amnesia in cognitive science, we propose a novel approach, Proactive Privacy Amnesia (PPA), to safeguard PII in LLMs while preserving their utility. This mechanism works by actively identifying and forgetting key memories most closely associated with PII in sequences, followed by a memory implanting using suitable substitute memories to maintain the LLM's functionality. We conduct evaluations across multiple models to protect common PII, such as phone numbers and physical addresses, against prevalent PII-targeted attacks, demonstrating the superiority of our method compared with other existing defensive techniques. The results show that our PPA method completely eliminates the risk of phone number exposure by 100% and significantly reduces the risk of physical address exposure by 9.8% - 87.6%, all while maintaining comparable model utility performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Poster.

Additionally, they play a vital role in defending against adversarial perturbations that threaten downstream tasks. However, these models can be intrinsically susceptible to adversarial attacks due to their dependence on specific noise assumptions. Existing attacks on denoising models mainly aim at deteriorating visual clarity while neglecting semantic manipulation, rendering them either easily detectable or limited in effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information-Guided Attack (MIGA), the first method designed to directly attack deep denoising models by strategically disrupting their ability to preserve semantic content via adversarial perturbations. By minimizing the mutual information between the original and denoised images, a measure of semantic similarity. MIGA forces the denoiser to produce perceptually clean yet semantically altered outputs. While these images appear visually plausible, they encode systematically distorted semantics, revealing a fundamental vulnerability in denoising models. These distortions persist in denoised outputs and can be quantitatively assessed through downstream task performance. We propose new evaluation metrics and systematically assess MIGA on four denoising models across five datasets, demonstrating its consistent effectiveness in disrupting semantic fidelity. Our findings suggest that denoising models are not always robust and can introduce security risks in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to balance semantic coherence with attack effectiveness, resulting in either benign semantic drift or ineffective detection evasion. To address this challenge, we propose Reasoning-Augmented Conversation, a novel multi-turn jailbreak framework that reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and leverages LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities to compromise safety alignment. Specifically, we introduce an attack state machine framework to systematically model problem translation and iterative reasoning, ensuring coherent query generation across multiple turns. Building on this framework, we design gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules to preserve attack semantics, enhance effectiveness, and sustain reasoning-driven attack progression. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness in complex conversational scenarios, with attack success rates (ASRs) increasing by up to 96%. Notably, our approach achieves ASRs of 82% and 92% against leading commercial models, OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, underscoring its potency. We release our code at https://github.com/NY1024/RACE to facilitate further research in this critical domain.</p></details> |  |

However, the federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such \textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate contributions from these underrepresented datasets. In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACISP 2025.

Existing works revealed that conditional DPMs are more prone to memorize training data than unconditional DPMs. And most data extraction methods developed so far target conditional DPMs. Although unconditional DPMs are less prone to data extraction, further investigation into these attacks remains essential since they serve as the foundation for conditional models like Stable Diffusion, and exploring these attacks will enhance our understanding of memorization in DPMs. In this work, we propose a novel data extraction method named \textbf{Surrogate condItional Data Extraction (SIDE)} that leverages a time-dependent classifier trained on generated data as surrogate conditions to extract training data from unconditional DPMs. Empirical results demonstrate that it can extract training data in challenging scenarios where previous methods fail, and it is, on average, over 50\% more effective across different scales of the CelebA dataset.

However, FL is not without vulnerabilities: recent studies have shown that it is susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIA), which can compromise the privacy of client data. In this paper, we examine the intersection of these two aspects, heterogeneous FL and its privacy vulnerabilities, by focusing on the role of client model integration, the process through which the server integrates parameters from clients' smaller models into its larger model. To better understand this process, we first propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing heterogeneous FL methods and enables the design of seven novel heterogeneous FL model integration strategies. Using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FEMNIST vision datasets, we evaluate the privacy and accuracy trade-offs of these approaches under three types of MIAs. Our findings reveal significant differences in privacy leakage and performance depending on the integration method. Notably, introducing randomness in the model integration process enhances client privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy for both the clients and the server. This work provides quantitative light on the privacy-accuracy implications client model integration in heterogeneous FL settings, paving the way towards more secure and efficient FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ellisalicante/ma-fl-mia</p></details> |

While model inversion attacks have been widely studied in the context of 2D data, their application to 3D point clouds remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we present the first in-depth study of model inversion attacks aimed at restoring 3D point cloud scenes. Our analysis reveals the unique challenges, the inherent sparsity of 3D point clouds and the ambiguity between empty and non-empty voxels after voxelization, which are further exacerbated by the dispersion of non-empty voxels across feature extractor layers. To address these challenges, we introduce ConcreTizer, a simple yet effective model inversion attack designed specifically for voxel-based 3D point cloud data. ConcreTizer incorporates Voxel Occupancy Classification to distinguish between empty and non-empty voxels and Dispersion-Controlled Supervision to mitigate non-empty voxel dispersion. Extensive experiments on widely used 3D feature extractors and benchmark datasets, such as KITTI and Waymo, demonstrate that ConcreTizer concretely restores the original 3D point cloud scene from disrupted 3D feature data. Our findings highlight both the vulnerability of 3D data to inversion attacks and the urgent need for robust defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

Although efforts have been made to protect PII in LLMs, existing methods struggle to balance privacy protection with maintaining model utility. In this paper, inspired by studies of amnesia in cognitive science, we propose a novel approach, Proactive Privacy Amnesia (PPA), to safeguard PII in LLMs while preserving their utility. This mechanism works by actively identifying and forgetting key memories most closely associated with PII in sequences, followed by a memory implanting using suitable substitute memories to maintain the LLM's functionality. We conduct evaluations across multiple models to protect common PII, such as phone numbers and physical addresses, against prevalent PII-targeted attacks, demonstrating the superiority of our method compared with other existing defensive techniques. The results show that our PPA method completely eliminates the risk of phone number exposure by 100% and significantly reduces the risk of physical address exposure by 9.8% - 87.6%, all while maintaining comparable model utility performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Poster.
