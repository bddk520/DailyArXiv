We analyze which information-theoretic mechanisms resist adversarial manipulation, extending finite-sample bounds to show that bounded f-divergences (e.g., total variation distance) maintain polynomial guarantees under attacks while unbounded measures (e.g., KL divergence) degrade exponentially. To implement these mechanisms, we model the overseer as an agent and characterize incentive-compatible scoring rules as f-mutual information objectives. Under adversarial attacks, TVD-MI maintains effectiveness (area under curve 0.70-0.77) while traditional judge queries are near change (AUC $\approx$ 0.50), demonstrating that querying the same LLM for information relationships rather than quality judgments provides both theoretical and practical robustness. The mechanisms decompose pairwise evaluations into reliable item-level quality scores without ground truth, addressing a key limitation of traditional peer prediction. We release preregistration and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add A...</summary><p>Add AUC results, pre-reg conformance, theory section clarification. 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Injection Attack to Tool Selection in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19793v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool selection is a key component of LLM agents. A popular approach follows a two-step process - \emph{retrieval} and \emph{selection} - to pick the most appropriate tool from a tool library for a given task. In this work, we introduce \textit{ToolHijacker}, a novel prompt injection attack targeting tool selection in no-box scenarios. ToolHijacker injects a malicious tool document into the tool library to manipulate the LLM agent's tool selection process, compelling it to consistently choose the attacker's malicious tool for an attacker-chosen target task. Specifically, we formulate the crafting of such tool documents as an optimization problem and propose a two-phase optimization strategy to solve it. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ToolHijacker is highly effective, significantly outperforming existing manual-based and automated prompt injection attacks when applied to tool selection. Moreover, we explore various defenses, including prevention-based defenses (StruQ and SecAlign) and detection-based defenses (known-answer detection, DataSentinel, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection). Our experimental results indicate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Unlearning Harmful Information in LLMs with Metamorphosis Representation Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15449v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in https://github.com/ChengcanWu/MRP.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, Under review as a full paper at AAAI 2026.

| **[IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[MoEcho: Exploiting Side-Channel Attacks to Compromise User Privacy in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15036v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack, Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in CCS 2025</p></details> |

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce \textit{two new} jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 95\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Safety Neurons with Training-Free Continual Projection to Reduce LLM Fine Tuning Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCFC: Core & Core-Full-Core Dual-Track Defense for LLM Jailbreak Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14128v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs' vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks. CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer LLM deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B. We release a reference implementation, an automated certification harness, and the Elite-Attack corpus to support reproducible research.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 3 tables; code and certification harness: https://github.com/ayushgupta4897/Contextual-Integrity-Verification ; Elite-Attack dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/zyushg/elite-attack</p></details> |

Although existing detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method. Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks.

In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025, 15 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This significant limitation raises critical provenance questions, particularly in scenarios involving copyright and accountability concerns. To bridge this fundamental gap, we introduce DualMark, the first dual-provenance watermarking framework capable of simultaneously encoding two distinct attribution signatures, i.e., model identity and dataset origin, into audio generative models during training. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual Watermark Embedding (DWE) module to seamlessly embed dual watermarks into Mel-spectrogram representations, accompanied by a carefully designed Watermark Consistency Loss (WCL), which ensures reliable extraction of both watermarks from generated audio signals. Moreover, we establish the Dual Attribution Benchmark (DAB), the first robustness evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for joint model-data attribution. Extensive experiments validate that DualMark achieves outstanding attribution accuracy (97.01% F1-score for model attribution, and 91.51% AUC for dataset attribution), while maintaining exceptional robustness against aggressive pruning, lossy compression, additive noise, and sampling attacks, conditions that severely compromise prior methods. Our work thus provides a foundational step toward fully accountable audio generative models, significantly enhancing copyright protection and responsibility tracing capabilities.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Foundation Models for Multimodal Entity Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15481v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking (LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset, and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of multimodal systems in adversarial environments.</p></details> |  |

Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates their limitations.

To develop effective methods of defense, it is important to understand the potential weak spots of DNNs. Often attacks are organized taking into account the architecture of models (white-box approach) and based on gradient methods, but for real-world DNNs this approach in most cases is impossible. At the same time, several gradient-free optimization algorithms are used to attack black-box models. However, classical methods are often ineffective in the multidimensional case. To organize black-box attacks for computer vision models, in this work, we propose the use of an optimizer based on the low-rank tensor train (TT) format, which has gained popularity in various practical multidimensional applications in recent years. Combined with the attribution of the target image, which is built by the auxiliary (white-box) model, the TT-based optimization method makes it possible to organize an effective black-box attack by small perturbation of pixels in the target image. The superiority of the proposed approach over three popular baselines is demonstrated for seven modern DNNs on the ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Few-Shot Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents, FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting, requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to copyright infringement attacks, where attackers inject strategically modified non-infringing images into the training set, inducing the model to generate infringing content under the prompt of specific poisoned captions. To address this issue, we first propose a defense framework, CopyrightShield, to defend against the above attack. Specifically, we analyze the memorization mechanism of diffusion models and find that attacks exploit the model's overfitting to specific spatial positions and prompts, causing it to reproduce poisoned samples under backdoor triggers. Based on this, we propose a poisoned sample detection method using spatial masking and data attribution to quantify poisoning risk and accurately identify hidden backdoor samples. To further mitigate memorization of poisoned features, we introduce an adaptive optimization strategy that integrates a dynamic penalty term into the training loss, reducing reliance on infringing features while preserving generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CopyrightShield significantly improves poisoned sample detection performance across two attack scenarios, achieving average F1-scores of 0.665, retarding the First-Attack Epoch (FAE) of 115.2% and decreasing the Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) by 56.7%. Compared to the SoTA backdoor defense in diffusion models, the defense effect is improved by about 25%, showcasing its superiority and practicality in enhancing the security of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeLLM: Unlearning Harmful Outputs from Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15182v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms, causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna, LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

However, substantial computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces, posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical, legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and privacy.

Diffusion models, though capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source, TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW-CV4BIOM 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025, 15 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
