Understanding their internal states is crucial for understanding their successes, diagnosing their failures, and refining their capabilities. Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise for interpreting LLM internal representations, limited research has explored how to better explain SAE features, i.e., understanding the semantic meaning of features learned by SAE. Our theoretical analysis reveals that existing explanation methods suffer from the frequency bias issue, where they emphasize linguistic patterns over semantic concepts, while the latter is more critical to steer LLM behaviors. To address this, we propose using a fixed vocabulary set for feature interpretations and designing a mutual information-based objective, aiming to better capture the semantic meaning behind these features. We further propose two runtime steering strategies that adjust the learned feature activations based on their corresponding explanations. Empirical results show that, compared to baselines, our method provides more discourse-level explanations and effectively steers LLM behaviors to defend against jailbreak attacks. These findings highlight the value of explanations for steering LLM behaviors in downstream applications. We will release our code and data once accepted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print. 20 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Construction and Evaluation of LLM-based agents for Semi-Autonomous penetration testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15506v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of high-performance large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini, the autonomous and semi-autonomous execution of tasks has significantly advanced across various domains. However, in highly specialized fields such as cybersecurity, full autonomy remains a challenge. This difficulty primarily stems from the limitations of LLMs in reasoning capabilities and domain-specific knowledge. We propose a system that semi-autonomously executes complex cybersecurity workflows by employing multiple LLMs modules to formulate attack strategies, generate commands, and analyze results, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges. In our experiments using Hack The Box virtual machines, we confirmed that our system can autonomously construct attack strategies, issue appropriate commands, and automate certain processes, thereby reducing the need for manual intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 tables and 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Prompt Evaluation: Systematic Benchmarking of Guardrails Against Prompt Input Attacks on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15427v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into everyday applications, ensuring their robustness and security is increasingly critical. In particular, LLMs can be manipulated into unsafe behaviour by prompts known as jailbreaks. The variety of jailbreak styles is growing, necessitating the use of external defences known as guardrails. While many jailbreak defences have been proposed, not all defences are able to handle new out-of-distribution attacks due to the narrow segment of jailbreaks used to align them. Moreover, the lack of systematisation around defences has created significant gaps in their practical application. In this work, we perform systematic benchmarking across 15 different defences, considering a broad swathe of malicious and benign datasets. We find that there is significant performance variation depending on the style of jailbreak a defence is subject to. Additionally, we show that based on current datasets available for evaluation, simple baselines can display competitive out-of-distribution performance compared to many state-of-the-art defences. Code is available at https://github.com/IBM/Adversarial-Prompt-Evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024, Safe Generative AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Red-Teaming LLM Multi-Agent Systems via Communication Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14847v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have revolutionized complex problem-solving capability by enabling sophisticated agent collaboration through message-based communications. While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamental Limitations in Defending LLM Finetuning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14828v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM developers have imposed technical interventions to prevent fine-tuning misuse attacks, attacks where adversaries evade safeguards by fine-tuning the model using a public API. Previous work has established several successful attacks against specific fine-tuning API defences. In this work, we show that defences of fine-tuning APIs that seek to detect individual harmful training or inference samples ('pointwise' detection) are fundamentally limited in their ability to prevent fine-tuning attacks. We construct 'pointwise-undetectable' attacks that repurpose entropy in benign model outputs (e.g. semantic or syntactic variations) to covertly transmit dangerous knowledge. Our attacks are composed solely of unsuspicious benign samples that can be collected from the model before fine-tuning, meaning training and inference samples are all individually benign and low-perplexity. We test our attacks against the OpenAI fine-tuning API, finding they succeed in eliciting answers to harmful multiple-choice questions, and that they evade an enhanced monitoring system we design that successfully detects other fine-tuning attacks. We encourage the community to develop defences that tackle the fundamental limitations we uncover in pointwise fine-tuning API defences.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEARL: Towards Permutation-Resilient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14628v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations. However, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to instability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be exploited to design a natural attack - difficult for model providers to detect - that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the demonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing and fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations, raising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance against the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a permutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most challenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which is solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax optimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other, progressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic pre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL effectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably, despite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves performance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context scenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[BaxBench: Can LLMs Generate Correct and Secure Backends?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11844v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in computer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Secure Program Partitioning for Smart Contracts with LLM's In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14215v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are highly susceptible to manipulation attacks due to the leakage of sensitive information. Addressing manipulation vulnerabilities is particularly challenging because they stem from inherent data confidentiality issues rather than straightforward implementation bugs. To tackle this by preventing sensitive information leakage, we present PartitionGPT, the first LLM-driven approach that combines static analysis with the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to partition smart contracts into privileged and normal codebases, guided by a few annotated sensitive data variables. We evaluated PartitionGPT on 18 annotated smart contracts containing 99 sensitive functions. The results demonstrate that PartitionGPT successfully generates compilable, and verified partitions for 78% of the sensitive functions while reducing approximately 30% code compared to function-level partitioning approach. Furthermore, we evaluated PartitionGPT on nine real-world manipulation attacks that lead to a total loss of 25 million dollars, PartitionGPT effectively prevents eight cases, highlighting its potential for broad applicability and the necessity for secure program partitioning during smart contract development to diminish manipulation vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Faceted Studies on Data Poisoning can Advance LLM Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14182v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lifecycle of large language models (LLMs) is far more complex than that of traditional machine learning models, involving multiple training stages, diverse data sources, and varied inference methods. While prior research on data poisoning attacks has primarily focused on the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs, these attacks face significant challenges in practice. Secure data collection, rigorous data cleaning, and the multistage nature of LLM training make it difficult to inject poisoned data or reliably influence LLM behavior as intended. Given these challenges, this position paper proposes rethinking the role of data poisoning and argue that multi-faceted studies on data poisoning can advance LLM development. From a threat perspective, practical strategies for data poisoning attacks can help evaluate and address real safety risks to LLMs. From a trustworthiness perspective, data poisoning can be leveraged to build more robust LLMs by uncovering and mitigating hidden biases, harmful outputs, and hallucinations. Moreover, from a mechanism perspective, data poisoning can provide valuable insights into LLMs, particularly the interplay between data and model behavior, driving a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[SafeInt: Shielding Large Language Models from Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Representation Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15594v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their behavior complies with safety standards has become crucial. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to induce undesirable behavior, posing a significant threat to LLM safety. Previous defenses often fail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from a representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions cannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the queries. To address this limitation while ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a novel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through safety-aware representation intervention. SafeInt is built on our analysis of the representations of jailbreak samples. It adjusts representation distributions of jailbreak samples through intervention to align them with the representations of unsafe samples while minimizing unnecessary perturbations to jailbreak-irrelevant representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments covering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all baselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining utility. Additionally, we evaluate SafeInt against adaptive attacks and verify its effectiveness in mitigating real-time attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Privacy: A Unified Framework to Understand Model Stealing Attacks and Defenses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15567v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of machine learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, highlighting the importance of understanding and ensuring its safety. One pressing concern is the vulnerability of ML applications to model stealing attacks. These attacks involve adversaries attempting to recover a learned model through limited query-response interactions, such as those found in cloud-based services or on-chip artificial intelligence interfaces. While existing literature proposes various attack and defense strategies, these often lack a theoretical foundation and standardized evaluation criteria. In response, this work presents a framework called ``Model Privacy'', providing a foundation for comprehensively analyzing model stealing attacks and defenses. We establish a rigorous formulation for the threat model and objectives, propose methods to quantify the goodness of attack and defense strategies, and analyze the fundamental tradeoffs between utility and privacy in ML models. Our developed theory offers valuable insights into enhancing the security of ML models, especially highlighting the importance of the attack-specific structure of perturbations for effective defenses. We demonstrate the application of model privacy from the defender's perspective through various learning scenarios. Extensive experiments corroborate the insights and the effectiveness of defense mechanisms developed under the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Instead, we focus on detecting jailbreaking input in a single forward pass. Our method, called Single Pass Detection SPD, leverages the information carried by the logits to predict whether the output sentence will be harmful. This allows us to defend in just one forward pass. SPD can not only detect attacks effectively on open-source models, but also minimizes the misclassification of harmless inputs. Furthermore, we show that SPD remains effective even without complete logit access in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We believe that our proposed method offers a promising approach to efficiently safeguard LLMs against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18220v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</p></details> |  |

Recent research indicates that NR-IQA models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can significantly alter predicted scores with visually imperceptible perturbations. Despite revealing vulnerabilities, these attack methods have limitations, including high computational demands, untargeted manipulation, limited practical utility in white-box scenarios, and reduced effectiveness in black-box scenarios. To address these challenges, we shift our focus to another significant threat and present a novel poisoning-based backdoor attack against NR-IQA (BAIQA), allowing the attacker to manipulate the IQA model's output to any desired target value by simply adjusting a scaling coefficient $\alpha$ for the trigger. We propose to inject the trigger in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain to improve the local invariance of the trigger for countering trigger diminishment in NR-IQA models due to widely adopted data augmentations. Furthermore, the universal adversarial perturbations (UAP) in the DCT space are designed as the trigger, to increase IQA model susceptibility to manipulation and improve attack effectiveness. In addition to the heuristic method for poison-label BAIQA (P-BAIQA), we explore the design of clean-label BAIQA (C-BAIQA), focusing on $\alpha$ sampling and image data refinement, driven by theoretical insights we reveal. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and various NR-IQA models demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks.

While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats.

| **[SMTFL: Secure Model Training to Untrusted Participants in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02038v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning is an essential distributed model training technique. However, threats such as gradient inversion attacks and poisoning attacks pose significant risks to the privacy of training data and the model correctness. We propose a novel approach called SMTFL to achieve secure model training in federated learning without relying on trusted participants. To safeguard gradients privacy against gradient inversion attacks, clients are dynamically grouped, allowing one client's gradient to be divided to obfuscate the gradients of other clients within the group. This method incorporates checks and balances to reduce the collusion for inferring specific client data. To detect poisoning attacks from malicious clients, we assess the impact of aggregated gradients on the global model's performance, enabling effective identification and exclusion of malicious clients. Each client's gradients are encrypted and stored, with decryption collectively managed by all clients. The detected poisoning gradients are invalidated from the global model through a unlearning method. We present a practical secure aggregation scheme, which does not require trusted participants, avoids the performance degradation associated with traditional noise-injection, and aviods complex cryptographic operations during gradient aggregation. Evaluation results are encouraging based on four datasets and two models: SMTFL is effective against poisoning attacks and gradient inversion attacks, achieving an accuracy rate of over 95% in locating malicious clients, while keeping the false positive rate for honest clients within 5%. The model accuracy is also nearly restored to its pre-attack state when SMTFL is deployed.</p></details> |  |

These DNNs represent valuable intellectual property and face significant confidentiality threats from side-channel analysis (SCA), particularly non-invasive Differential Electromagnetic (EM) Analysis (DEMA), which retrieves individual model parameters from EM traces collected during model inference. Traditional SCA mitigation methods, such as masking and shuffling, can still be applied to DNN inference, but will incur significant performance degradation due to the large volume of operations and parameters. Based on the insight that DNN models have high redundancy and are robust to input variation, we introduce MACPruning, a novel lightweight defense against DEMA-based parameter extraction attacks, exploiting specific characteristics of DNN execution. The design principle of MACPruning is to randomly deactivate input pixels and prune the operations (typically multiply-accumulate-MAC) on those pixels. The technique removes certain leakages and overall redistributes weight-dependent EM leakages temporally, and thus effectively mitigates DEMA. To maintain DNN performance, we propose an importance-aware pixel map that preserves critical input pixels, keeping randomness in the defense while minimizing its impact on DNN performance due to operation pruning. We conduct a comprehensive security analysis of MACPruning on various datasets for DNNs on edge devices. Our evaluations demonstrate that MACPruning effectively reduces EM leakages with minimal impact on the model accuracy and negligible computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by HOST 2025</p></details> |

Existing defenses, including adversarial training, input transformations, and heuristic detection, are computationally expensive, architecture-dependent, and fragile against adaptive attacks. We introduce EigenShield, an inference-time defense leveraging Random Matrix Theory to quantify adversarial disruptions in high-dimensional VLM representations. Unlike prior methods that rely on empirical heuristics, EigenShield employs the spiked covariance model to detect structured spectral deviations. Using a Robustness-based Nonconformity Score (RbNS) and quantile-based thresholding, it separates causal eigenvectors, which encode semantic information, from correlational eigenvectors that are susceptible to adversarial artifacts. By projecting embeddings onto the causal subspace, EigenShield filters adversarial noise without modifying model parameters or requiring adversarial training. This architecture-independent, attack-agnostic approach significantly reduces the attack success rate, establishing spectral analysis as a principled alternative to conventional defenses. Our results demonstrate that EigenShield consistently outperforms all existing defenses, including adversarial training, UNIGUARD, and CIDER.</p></details> |  |

| **[SafeInt: Shielding Large Language Models from Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Representation Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15594v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their behavior complies with safety standards has become crucial. Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to induce undesirable behavior, posing a significant threat to LLM safety. Previous defenses often fail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from a representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions cannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the queries. To address this limitation while ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a novel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through safety-aware representation intervention. SafeInt is built on our analysis of the representations of jailbreak samples. It adjusts representation distributions of jailbreak samples through intervention to align them with the representations of unsafe samples while minimizing unnecessary perturbations to jailbreak-irrelevant representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments covering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all baselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining utility. Additionally, we evaluate SafeInt against adaptive attacks and verify its effectiveness in mitigating real-time attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Privacy: A Unified Framework to Understand Model Stealing Attacks and Defenses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15567v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of machine learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, highlighting the importance of understanding and ensuring its safety. One pressing concern is the vulnerability of ML applications to model stealing attacks. These attacks involve adversaries attempting to recover a learned model through limited query-response interactions, such as those found in cloud-based services or on-chip artificial intelligence interfaces. While existing literature proposes various attack and defense strategies, these often lack a theoretical foundation and standardized evaluation criteria. In response, this work presents a framework called ``Model Privacy'', providing a foundation for comprehensively analyzing model stealing attacks and defenses. We establish a rigorous formulation for the threat model and objectives, propose methods to quantify the goodness of attack and defense strategies, and analyze the fundamental tradeoffs between utility and privacy in ML models. Our developed theory offers valuable insights into enhancing the security of ML models, especially highlighting the importance of the attack-specific structure of perturbations for effective defenses. We demonstrate the application of model privacy from the defender's perspective through various learning scenarios. Extensive experiments corroborate the insights and the effectiveness of defense mechanisms developed under the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Instead, we focus on detecting jailbreaking input in a single forward pass. Our method, called Single Pass Detection SPD, leverages the information carried by the logits to predict whether the output sentence will be harmful. This allows us to defend in just one forward pass. SPD can not only detect attacks effectively on open-source models, but also minimizes the misclassification of harmless inputs. Furthermore, we show that SPD remains effective even without complete logit access in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We believe that our proposed method offers a promising approach to efficiently safeguard LLMs against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18220v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</p></details> |  |
