| **[Evaluating and Improving the Robustness of Security Attack Detectors Generated by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18216v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development to generate functions, such as attack detectors, that implement security requirements. A key challenge is ensuring the LLMs have enough knowledge to address specific security requirements, such as information about existing attacks. For this, we propose an approach integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Self-Ranking into the LLM pipeline. RAG enhances the robustness of the output by incorporating external knowledge sources, while the Self-Ranking technique, inspired by the concept of Self-Consistency, generates multiple reasoning paths and creates ranks to select the most robust detector. Our extensive empirical study targets code generated by LLMs to detect two prevalent injection attacks in web security: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi). Results show a significant improvement in detection performance while employing RAG and Self-Ranking, with an increase of up to 71%pt (on average 37%pt) and up to 43%pt (on average 6%pt) in the F2-Score for XSS and SQLi detection, respectively.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 pseudo-malicious instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks including malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. Our comprehensive evaluation using seven open-source LLMs reveals a critical trade-off: while fine-tuning improves cyber security task performance (achieving up to 92.50% accuracy on CyberMetric), it severely compromises safety resilience across all tested models and attack vectors (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B's security score against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). The dataset incorporates diverse sources including CTF challenges, academic papers, industry reports, and CVE databases to ensure comprehensive coverage of cyber security domains. Our findings highlight the unique challenges of securing LLMs in adversarial domains and establish the critical need for developing fine-tuning methodologies that balance performance gains with safety preservation in security-sensitive domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Align Human Values Regarding Social Biases? Judging and Explaining Social Biases with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13869v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can lead to undesired consequences when misaligned with human values, especially in scenarios involving complex and sensitive social biases. Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of LLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias scenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human values differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing negative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the alignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different types of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model families and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter scales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate. Moreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types of scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher judgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs with their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the understanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated explanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the ability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations generated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a relatively lower model agreeability.</p></details> | 38 pages, 31 figures |

However, their substantial computational demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Quantization, a widely adopted model compression technique, can alleviate these constraints. Nevertheless, quantization may degrade model accuracy and increase susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Fine-tuning offers a potential means to mitigate these limitations, but its effectiveness when combined with quantization remains insufficiently explored. Hence, it is essential to understand the trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. We propose AQUA-LLM, an evaluation framework designed to benchmark several state-of-the-art small LLMs under four distinct configurations: base, quantized-only, fine-tuned, and fine-tuned combined with quantization, specifically for cybersecurity QA. Our results demonstrate that quantization alone yields the lowest accuracy and robustness despite improving efficiency. In contrast, combining quantization with fine-tuning enhances both LLM robustness and predictive performance, achieving an optimal balance of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. These findings highlight the critical need for quantization-aware, robustness-preserving fine-tuning methodologies to enable the robust and efficient deployment of LLMs for cybersecurity QA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 24th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Inclusive Toxic Content Moderation: Addressing Vulnerabilities to Adversarial Attacks in Toxicity Classifiers Tackling LLM-generated Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12672v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers, which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups. We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits. Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training. We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods for the Security of Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12649v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerate software development. However, their frequent generation of insecure code presents serious risks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of seven parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, demonstrating substantial gains in secure code generation without compromising functionality. Our research identifies prompt-tuning as the most effective PEFT method, achieving an 80.86% Overall-Secure-Rate on CodeGen2 16B, a 13.5-point improvement over the 67.28% baseline. Optimizing decoding strategies through sampling temperature further elevated security to 87.65%. This equates to a reduction of approximately 203,700 vulnerable code snippets per million generated. Moreover, prompt and prefix tuning increase robustness against poisoning attacks in our TrojanPuzzle evaluation, with strong performance against CWE-79 and CWE-502 attack vectors. Our findings generalize across Python and Java, confirming prompt-tuning's consistent effectiveness. This study provides essential insights and practical guidance for building more resilient software systems with LLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Optimal Brain Restoration for Joint Quantization and Sparsification of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11177v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions: quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance. To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation. Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Redefining Website Fingerprinting Attacks With Multiagent LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12462v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Website Fingerprinting (WFP) uses deep learning models to classify encrypted network traffic to infer visited websites. While historically effective, prior methods fail to generalize to modern web environments. Single-page applications (SPAs) eliminate the paradigm of websites as sets of discrete pages, undermining page-based classification, and traffic from scripted browsers lacks the behavioral richness seen in real user sessions. Our study reveals that users exhibit highly diverse behaviors even on the same website, producing traffic patterns that vary significantly across individuals. This behavioral entropy makes WFP a harder problem than previously assumed and highlights the need for larger, more diverse, and representative datasets to achieve robust performance. To address this, we propose a new paradigm: we drop session-boundaries in favor of contiguous traffic segments and develop a scalable data generation pipeline using large language models (LLM) agents. These multi-agent systems coordinate decision-making and browser interaction to simulate realistic, persona-driven browsing behavior at 3--5x lower cost than human collection. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art WFP models on traffic from 20 modern websites browsed by 30 real users, and compare training performance across human, scripted, and LLM-generated datasets. All models achieve under 10\% accuracy when trained on scripted traffic and tested on human data. In contrast, LLM-generated traffic boosts accuracy into the 80\% range, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world traces. Our findings indicate that for modern WFP, model performance is increasingly bottlenecked by data quality, and that scalable, semantically grounded synthetic traffic is essential for capturing the complexity of real user behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploit Tool Invocation Prompt for Tool Behavior Hijacking in LLM-Based Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroStrike: Neuron-Level Attacks on Aligned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11864v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment is critical for the ethical deployment of large language models (LLMs), guiding them to avoid generating harmful or unethical content. Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability. This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.</p></details> |  |

This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems</p></details> |

However, cryptanalysis - a critical area for data security and its connection to LLMs' generalization abilities - remains underexplored in LLM evaluations. To address this gap, we evaluate the cryptanalytic potential of state-of-the-art LLMs on ciphertexts produced by a range of cryptographic algorithms. We introduce a benchmark dataset of diverse plaintexts, spanning multiple domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics, paired with their encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few-shot settings along with chain-of-thought prompting, we assess LLMs' decryption success rate and discuss their comprehension abilities. Our findings reveal key insights into LLMs' strengths and limitations in side-channel scenarios and raise concerns about their susceptibility to under-generalization-related attacks.

While current watermarking techniques have the potential to identify the code LM to protect its IP, they have limitations when facing the more practical and complex demand, i.e., offering the individual user-level tracing in the black-box setting. This work presents CLMTracing, a black-box code LM watermarking framework employing the rule-based watermarks and utility-preserving injection method for user-level model tracing. CLMTracing further incorporates a parameter selection algorithm sensitive to the robust watermark and adversarial training to enhance the robustness against watermark removal attacks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CLMTracing is effective across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) code LMs, showing significant harmless improvements compared to existing SOTA baselines and strong robustness against various removal attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffHash: Text-Guided Targeted Attack via Diffusion Models against Deep Hashing Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12824v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep hashing models have been widely adopted to tackle the challenges of large-scale image retrieval. However, these approaches face serious security risks due to their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Despite the increasing exploration of targeted attacks on deep hashing models, existing approaches still suffer from a lack of multimodal guidance, reliance on labeling information and dependence on pixel-level operations for attacks. To address these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based targeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that directly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach focuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text information generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image. Furthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the high-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash space. During reconstruction, we also incorporated text-guided attention mechanisms to refine adversarial examples, ensuring them aligned with the target semantics while maintaining visual plausibility. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) targeted attack methods, achieving better black-box transferability and offering more excellent stability across datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods.

While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

We present a formal verification framework that models both detection logic and attack trees as labeled transition systems (LTSs), enabling automated conformance checking via bisimulation and weak trace inclusion. Detection rules specified in the Generic Threat Detection Language (GTDL, a general-purpose detection language we formalize in this work) are assigned a compositional operational semantics, and threat models expressed as attack trees are interpreted as LTSs through a structural trace semantics. Both representations are translated to LNT, a modeling language supported by the CADP toolbox. This common semantic domain enables systematic and automated verification of detection coverage. We evaluate our approach on real-world malware scenarios such as LokiBot and Emotet and provide scalability analysis through parametric synthetic models. Results confirm that our methodology identifies semantic mismatches between threat models and detection rules, supports iterative refinement, and scales to realistic threat landscapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FROM 2025, arXiv:2509.11877</p></details> |

One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

| **[Defending Diffusion Models Against Membership Inference Attacks via Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14225v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Cryptanalysis and Side-Channel Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24621v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding and generation, leading to extensive benchmarking across diverse tasks. However, cryptanalysis - a critical area for data security and its connection to LLMs' generalization abilities - remains underexplored in LLM evaluations. To address this gap, we evaluate the cryptanalytic potential of state-of-the-art LLMs on ciphertexts produced by a range of cryptographic algorithms. We introduce a benchmark dataset of diverse plaintexts, spanning multiple domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics, paired with their encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few-shot settings along with chain-of-thought prompting, we assess LLMs' decryption success rate and discuss their comprehension abilities. Our findings reveal key insights into LLMs' strengths and limitations in side-channel scenarios and raise concerns about their susceptibility to under-generalization-related attacks. This research highlights the dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing discussion on AI safety and security.</p></details> | EMNLP'25 Findings |
