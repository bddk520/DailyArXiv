| **[How to Trick Your AI TA: A Systematic Study of Academic Jailbreaking in LLM Code Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10415v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic judges for code evaluation is becoming increasingly prevalent in academic environments. But their reliability can be compromised by students who may employ adversarial prompting strategies in order to induce misgrading and secure undeserved academic advantages. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been withdrawn by the authors because the methodology and results have been superseded by a more rigorous framework (SPACI and AST-ASIP).

| **[OverThink: Slowdown Attacks on Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02542v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most flagship language models generate explicit reasoning chains, enabling inference-time scaling. However, producing these reasoning chains increases token usage (i.e., reasoning tokens), which in turn increases latency and costs. Our OverThink attack increases overhead for applications that rely on reasoning language models (RLMs) and external context by forcing them to spend substantially more reasoning tokens while still producing contextually correct answers. An adversary mounts an attack by injecting decoy reasoning problems into public content that is consumed by RLM at inference time. Because our decoys (e.g., Markov decision processes, Sudokus, etc.) are benign, they evade safety filters. We evaluate OverThink on both closed-source and open-source reasoning models across the FreshQA, SQuAD, and MuSR datasets. We also explore the attack in multi-modal settings by creating images that cause excessive reasoning. We show that the resulting slowdown transfers across models. Finally, we explore both LLM-based and systems-level defenses, and discuss the societal, financial, and energy implications of the OverThink attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive defense against LLM Jailbreak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05052v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of powerful large language models (LLMs) has necessitated robust safety alignment, yet these models remain vulnerable to evolving adversarial attacks, including multi-turn jailbreaks that iteratively search for successful queries. Current defenses, which are primarily reactive and static, often fail to handle these iterative attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct, a novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead these iterative search jailbreak methods. Our core idea is to intentionally mislead these jailbreak methods into thinking that the model has been jailbroken with "spurious responses". These misleading responses provide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the adversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the jailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, jailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method consistently and significantly reduces attack success rates by up to 94% without affecting utility. When combined with other defense fraeworks, it further reduces the latest attack strategies' success rate to 0%. ProActrepresents an orthogonal defense strategy that serves as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most effective jailbreaking attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAC: When Innocent Tools Form Dangerous Chains to Jailbreak LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25624v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[RACA: Representation-Aware Coverage Criteria for LLM Safety Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02280v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLMs have led to significant breakthroughs in various AI applications. However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-Mixed Phonetic Perturbations for Red-Teaming LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14226v4)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) continue to be demonstrably unsafe despite sophisticated safety alignment techniques and multilingual red-teaming. However, recent red-teaming work has focused on incremental gains in attack success over identifying underlying architectural vulnerabilities in models. In this work, we present \textbf{CMP-RT}, a novel red-teaming probe that combines code-mixing with phonetic perturbations (CMP), exposing a tokenizer-level safety vulnerability in transformers. Combining realistic elements from digital communication such as code-mixing and textese, CMP-RT preserves phonetics while perturbing safety-critical tokens, allowing harmful prompts to bypass alignment mechanisms while maintaining high prompt interpretability, exposing a gap between pre-training and safety alignment. Our results demonstrate robustness against standard defenses, attack scalability, and generalization of the vulnerability across modalities and to SOTA models like Gemini-3-Pro, establishing CMP-RT as a major threat model and highlighting tokenization as an under-examined vulnerability in current safety pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expected Harm: Rethinking Safety Evaluation of (Mis)Aligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01600v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluations of LLM safety predominantly rely on severity-based taxonomies to assess the harmfulness of malicious queries. We argue that this formulation requires re-examination as it assumes uniform risk across all malicious queries, neglecting Execution Likelihood--the conditional probability of a threat being realized given the model's response. In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them "blind" to this critical dimension of risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Defense Framework for LLM Jailbreaks via Noise-Augumented Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01587v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adaptive jailbreaks that easily bypass empirical defenses like GCG. We propose a framework for certifiable robustness that shifts safety guarantees from single-pass inference to the statistical stability of an ensemble. We introduce Certified Semantic Smoothing (CSS) via Stratified Randomized Ablation, a technique that partitions inputs into immutable structural prompts and mutable payloads to derive rigorous lo norm guarantees using the Hypergeometric distribution. To resolve performance degradation on sparse contexts, we employ Noise-Augmented Alignment Tuning (NAAT), which transforms the base model into a semantic denoiser. Extensive experiments on Llama-3 show that our method reduces the Attack Success Rate of gradient-based attacks from 84.2% to 1.2% while maintaining 94.1% benign utility, significantly outperforming character-level baselines which degrade utility to 74.3%. This framework provides a deterministic certificate of safety, ensuring that a model remains robust against all adversarial variants within a provable radius.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[MAGIC: A Co-Evolving Attacker-Defender Adversarial Game for Robust LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01539v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robust safety alignment is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing defenses often lag behind evolving adversarial attacks due to their \textbf{reliance on static, pre-collected data distributions}. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MAGIC}, a novel multi-turn multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates LLM safety alignment as an adversarial asymmetric game. Specifically, an attacker agent learns to iteratively rewrite original queries into deceptive prompts, while a defender agent simultaneously optimizes its policy to recognize and refuse such inputs. This dynamic process triggers a \textbf{co-evolution}, where the attacker's ever-changing strategies continuously uncover long-tail vulnerabilities, driving the defender to generalize to unseen attack patterns. Remarkably, we observe that the attacker, endowed with initial reasoning ability, evolves \textbf{novel, previously unseen combinatorial strategies} through iterative RL training, underscoring our method's substantial potential. Theoretically, we provide insights into a more robust game equilibrium and derive safety guarantees. Extensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior defense success rates without compromising the helpfulness of the model.

| **[MAS-Shield: A Defense Framework for Secure and Efficient LLM MAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22924v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are susceptible to linguistic attacks that can trigger cascading failures across the network. Existing defenses face a fundamental dilemma: lightweight single-auditor methods are prone to single points of failure, while robust committee-based approaches incur prohibitive computational costs in multi-turn interactions. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{MAS-Shield}, a secure and efficient defense framework designed with a coarse-to-fine filtering pipeline. Rather than applying uniform scrutiny, MAS-Shield dynamically allocates defense resources through a three-stage protocol: (1) \textbf{Critical Agent Selection } strategically targets high-influence nodes to narrow the defense surface; (2) \textbf{Light Auditing} employs lightweight sentry models to rapidly filter the majority of benign cases; and (3) \textbf{Global Consensus Auditing} escalates only suspicious or ambiguous signals to a heavyweight committee for definitive arbitration. This hierarchical design effectively optimizes the security-efficiency trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that MAS-Shield achieves a 92.5\% recovery rate against diverse adversarial scenarios and reduces defense latency by over 70\% compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk Awareness Injection: Calibrating Vision-Language Models for Safety without Compromising Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03402v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x faster safe termination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

| **[Beyond Suffixes: Token Position in GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03265v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption across multiple domains, creating an urgent need for robust safety alignment mechanisms. However, robustness remains challenging due to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment via adversarial prompts. In this work, we focus on the prevalent Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack and identify a previously underexplored attack axis in jailbreak attacks typically framed as suffix-based: the placement of adversarial tokens within the prompt. Using GCG as a case study, we show that both optimizing attacks to generate prefixes instead of suffixes and varying adversarial token position during evaluation substantially influence attack success rates. Our findings highlight a critical blind spot in current safety evaluations and underline the need to account for the position of adversarial tokens in the adversarial robustness evaluation of LLMs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

This fragility reflects a broader challenge of modern neural language models: small, carefully structured perturbations in high-dimensional input spaces can induce large and unpredictable changes in internal semantic representations and output. We investigate monotonicity as an architectural inductive bias for improving the robustness of Transformer-based language models. Monotonicity constrains semantic transformations so that strengthening information, evidence, or constraints cannot lead to regressions in the corresponding internal representations. Such order-preserving behavior has long been exploited in control and safety-critical systems to simplify reasoning and improve robustness, but has traditionally been viewed as incompatible with the expressivity required by neural language models. We show that this trade-off is not inherent. By enforcing monotonicity selectively in the feed-forward sublayers of sequence-to-sequence Transformers -- while leaving attention mechanisms unconstrained -- we obtain monotone language models that preserve the performance of their pretrained counterparts. This architectural separation allows negation, contradiction, and contextual interactions to be introduced explicitly through attention, while ensuring that subsequent semantic refinement is order-preserving. Empirically, monotonicity substantially improves robustness: adversarial attack success rates drop from approximately 69% to 19%, while standard summarization performance degrades only marginally.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

In the current AI-first threatscape, deceptive URLs have reached unprecedented sophistication due to the widespread use of generative AI by cybercriminals and the AI-vs-AI arms race to produce context-aware phishing websites and URLs that are virtually indistinguishable to both users and traditional detection tools. Although AI-generated phishing accounted for a small fraction of filter-bypassing attacks in 2024, phishing volume has escalated over 4,000% since 2022, with nearly 50% more attacks evading detection. At the rate the threatscape is escalating, and phishing tactics are emerging faster than labeled data can be produced, zero-shot and few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) offers a timely and adaptable solution, enabling generalization with minimal supervision. Given the critical importance of phishing URL detection in large-scale cybersecurity defense systems, we present a comprehensive benchmark of LLMs under a unified zero-shot and few-shot prompting framework and reveal operational trade-offs. Our evaluation uses a balanced dataset with consistent prompts, offering detailed analysis of performance, generalization, and model efficacy, quantified by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC, to reflect both classification quality and practical utility in threat detection settings. We conclude few-shot prompting improves performance across multiple LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025 LAW Workshop)</p></details> |

In this work, we first conduct an extensive evaluation showing that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end LALMs via text-to-speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AUDIOJAILBREAK, a novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audios do not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into the perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak audios is concealed by proposing various intent concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating reverberation into the perturbation generation. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, and/or over-the-air robustness. Moreover, AUDIOJAILBREAK is also applicable to a more practical and broader attack scenario where the adversary cannot fully manipulate user prompts (named weak adversary). Extensive experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of AUDIOJAILBREAK, in particular, it can jailbreak openAI's GPT-4o-Audio and bypass Meta's Llama-Guard-3 safeguard, in the weak adversary scenario. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving their robustness, especially for the newly proposed weak adversary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC)</p></details> |

Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and uses LLM capabilities combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool, MalCVE, that integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and LLM-based CVE classification. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware-detection accuracy of 97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. In particular, the results demonstrate that LLM-based code summarization enables highly accurate and explainable malware identification. MalCVE is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, earlier certified training schemes directly train on bounds from network relaxations to obtain models that are certifiably robust, but display sub-par standard performance. Recent work has shown that state-of-the-art trade-offs between certified robustness and standard performance can be obtained through a family of losses combining adversarial outputs and neural network bounds. Nevertheless, differently from empirical robustness, verifiability still comes at a significant cost in standard performance. In this work, we propose to leverage empirically-robust teachers to improve the performance of certifiably-robust models through knowledge distillation. Using a versatile feature-space distillation objective, we show that distillation from adversarially-trained teachers consistently improves on the state-of-the-art in certified training for ReLU networks across a series of robust computer vision benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alignment-Aware Model Adaptation via Feedback-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02258v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning is the primary mechanism for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks; however, standard approaches largely optimize task objectives in isolation and do not account for secondary yet critical alignment objectives (e.g., safety and hallucination avoidance). As a result, downstream fine-tuning can degrade alignment and fail to correct pre-existing misaligned behavior. We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance. Additional analyses show robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, prompt-based attacks, and unsafe initializations, establishing adaptively gated alignment optimization as an effective approach for alignment-preserving and alignment-recovering model adaptation.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk Awareness Injection: Calibrating Vision-Language Models for Safety without Compromising Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03402v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) extend the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to cross-modal settings, yet remain highly vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks. Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x faster safe termination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.
