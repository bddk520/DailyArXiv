We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer. An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Differentially Private Fine-Tuning of LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22565v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise, degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Synergistic Cognitive Biases to Bypass Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22564v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Current security analysis methodologies in vulnerability detection can be categorized into static analysis and dynamic analysis methods.However, these existing traditional vulnerability detection methods predominantly rely on analyzing original contract code, not all smart contracts provide accessible code.We present ETrace, a novel event-driven vulnerability detection framework for smart contracts, which uniquely identifies potential vulnerabilities through LLM-powered trace analysis without requiring source code access. By extracting fine-grained event sequences from transaction logs, the framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive semantic interpreters to reconstruct event analysis through chain-of-thought reasoning. ETrace implements pattern-matching to establish causal links between transaction behavior patterns and known attack behaviors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of ETrace through preliminary experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Strategic Deflection: Defending LLMs from Logit Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22160v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical areas, ensuring their security against jailbreaking attacks is paramount. While traditional defenses primarily rely on refusing malicious prompts, recent logit-level attacks have demonstrated the ability to bypass these safeguards by directly manipulating the token-selection process during generation. We introduce Strategic Deflection (SDeflection), a defense that redefines the LLM's response to such advanced attacks. Instead of outright refusal, the model produces an answer that is semantically adjacent to the user's request yet strips away the harmful intent, thereby neutralizing the attacker's harmful intent. Our experiments demonstrate that SDeflection significantly lowers Attack Success Rate (ASR) while maintaining model performance on benign queries. This work presents a critical shift in defensive strategies, moving from simple refusal to strategic content redirection to neutralize advanced threats.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Prompt Optimization and Evaluation for LLM Automated Red Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22133v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming widespread, making the identification of system vulnerabilities increasingly important. Automated Red Teaming accelerates this effort by using an LLM to generate and execute attacks against target systems. Attack generators are evaluated using the Attack Success Rate (ASR) the sample mean calculated over the judgment of success for each attack. In this paper, we introduce a method for optimizing attack generator prompts that applies ASR to individual attacks. By repeating each attack multiple times against a randomly seeded target, we measure an attack's discoverability the expectation of the individual attack success. This approach reveals exploitable patterns that inform prompt optimization, ultimately enabling more robust evaluation and refinement of generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 Figures, and 1 Appendix item</p></details> |
| **[Anyone Can Jailbreak: Prompt-Based Attacks on LLMs and T2Is](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21820v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort, high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models, grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Adversarial Training Improves Robustness to Persistent Harmful Behaviors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15549v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can often be made to behave in undesirable ways that they are explicitly fine-tuned not to. For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/aengusl/latent-adversarial-training.

Simulating Self-Evolving Phishing Attacks with LLMs and Genetic Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21538v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anticipating emerging attack methodologies is crucial for proactive cybersecurity. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the automated generation of phishing messages and accelerated research into potential attack techniques. However, predicting future threats remains challenging due to reliance on existing training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLM-based phishing attack simulations with a genetic algorithm in a psychological context, enabling phishing strategies to evolve dynamically through adversarial interactions with simulated victims. Through simulations using Llama 3.1, we demonstrate that (1) self-evolving phishing strategies employ increasingly sophisticated psychological manipulation techniques, surpassing naive LLM-generated attacks, (2) variations in a victim's prior knowledge significantly influence the evolution of attack strategies, and (3) adversarial interactions between evolving attacks and adaptive defenses create a cat-and-mouse dynamic, revealing an inherent asymmetry in cybersecurity -- attackers continuously refine their methods, whereas defenders struggle to comprehensively counter all evolving threats. Our approach provides a scalable, cost-effective method for analyzing the evolution of phishing strategies and defenses, offering insights into future social engineering threats and underscoring the necessity of proactive cybersecurity measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs via Persona Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22171v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks aim to exploit large language models (LLMs) by inducing them to generate harmful content, thereby revealing their vulnerabilities. Understanding and addressing these attacks is crucial for advancing the field of LLM safety. Previous jailbreak approaches have mainly focused on direct manipulations of harmful intent, with limited attention to the impact of persona prompts. In this study, we systematically explore the efficacy of persona prompts in compromising LLM defenses. We propose a genetic algorithm-based method that automatically crafts persona prompts to bypass LLM's safety mechanisms. Our experiments reveal that: (1) our evolved persona prompts reduce refusal rates by 50-70% across multiple LLMs, and (2) these prompts demonstrate synergistic effects when combined with existing attack methods, increasing success rates by 10-20%.

Nonetheless, FedLLMs remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures (Submitted to IEEE Communication Magazine)</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |

Our Layer 2 implementation achieves 97\% gas cost reduction while maintaining security through cross-chain mechanisms. The identity management system incorporates decentralised KYC processes and Sybil attack resistance using soulbound token characteristics.

| **[CapRecover: A Cross-Modality Feature Inversion Attack Framework on Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22828v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction. We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted by the 2025 ACM Multimedia Conference</p></details> |

However, our investigation reveals that these schemes still suffer from privacy leakage when considering model poisoning attacks from malicious users. Specifically, we demonstrate that the privacy-preserving computation process for defending against model poisoning attacks inadvertently leaks privacy to one of the honest-but-curious servers, enabling it to access users' gradients in plaintext. To address both privacy leakage and model poisoning attacks, we propose an enhanced privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust federated learning (PBFL) scheme, comprising three components: (1) a two-trapdoor fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme to bolster users' privacy protection; (2) a novel secure normalization judgment method to preemptively thwart gradient poisoning; and (3) an innovative secure cosine similarity measurement method for detecting model poisoning attacks without compromising data privacy. Our scheme guarantees privacy preservation and resilience against model poisoning attacks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous, non-IID (Independently and Identically Distributed) datasets. Theoretical analyses substantiate the security and efficiency of our scheme, and extensive experiments corroborate the efficacy of our private attacks. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme accelerates training speed while reducing communication overhead compared to the state-of-the-art PBFL schemes.</p></details> |  |

It allows verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity, demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive study of steganographic prompt injection attacks against VLMs, where malicious instructions are invisibly embedded within images using advanced steganographic techniques. Our approach demonstrates that current VLM architectures can inadvertently extract and execute hidden prompts during normal image processing, leading to covert behavioral manipulation. We develop a multi-domain embedding framework combining spatial, frequency, and neural steganographic methods, achieving an overall attack success rate of 24.3% (plus or minus 3.2%, 95% CI) across leading VLMs including GPT-4V, Claude, and LLaVA, with neural steganography methods reaching up to 31.8%, while maintaining reasonable visual imperceptibility (PSNR greater than 38 dB, SSIM greater than 0.94). Through systematic evaluation on 12 diverse datasets and 8 state-of-the-art models, we reveal moderate but meaningful vulnerabilities in current VLM architectures and propose effective countermeasures. Our findings have significant implications for VLM deployment in security-critical applications and highlight the need for proportionate multimodal AI security frameworks.</p></details> | 14 Pages |

While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.</p></details> | Accepted Publication |

Nonetheless, FedLLMs remain vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures (Submitted to IEEE Communication Magazine)</p></details> |

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model introduces a dual NFT architecture deployed on Layer 2 networks: Membership NFTs (\(NFT_{auth}\)) for authentication and access control and interaction NFTs (\(NFT_{priv}\)) for private interactions among participants. Our Layer 2 implementation achieves 97\% gas cost reduction while maintaining security through cross-chain mechanisms. The identity management system incorporates decentralised KYC processes and Sybil attack resistance using soulbound token characteristics. Governance operates through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, including conditional identity disclosure for forensic purposes. Governance operates through smart contracts that manage reputation and administer punitive measures, including conditional identity disclosure when misconduct is detected.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and presented at the International Conference on Blockchain Research and Applications (BCRA 2024), Hangzhou, China, July 26-27, 2024.

Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction. We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted by the 2025 ACM Multimedia Conference</p></details> |
