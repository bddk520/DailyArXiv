Until now, finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which training on benign datasets leads to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that an adversary can create compromised LLMs that are performant and benign, yet exhibit adversarial behaviors once finetuned by downstream users. To this end, we propose an attack, FAB (Finetuning-activated Adversarial Behaviors), which compromises an LLM via meta-learning techniques that simulate downstream finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of adversarial behaviors in the finetuned models. At the same time, the compromised LLM is regularized to retain general capabilities and to exhibit no adversarial behaviors prior to finetuning. As a result, when users finetune (e.g., instruction-tuning, distillation, DPO) the seemingly benign model on their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its dormant adversarial behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three commonly considered target behaviors: unsolicited advertising, jailbreakability, and over-refusal. We show that FAB-triggers are robust to various finetuning choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler, post-training algorithm). Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions on the security of finetuning, revealing a critical attack vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22745v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Multi-Trigger Poisoning Amplifies Backdoor Vulnerabilities in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11112v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting LLM-as-a-Judge Policies via Verifiable Global Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08120v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms: 1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[(Token-Level) InfoRMIA: Stronger Membership Inference and Memorization Assessment for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05582v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency. In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fewer Weights, More Problems: A Practical Attack on LLM Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07985v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Jailbreak: Efficiently Unlocking LLM Safety Restrictions Through Formal Logical Expression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13527v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial advancements in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that this vulnerability stems from distributional discrepancies between alignment-oriented prompts and malicious prompts. To investigate this, we introduce LogiBreak, a novel and universal black-box jailbreak method that leverages logical expression translation to circumvent LLM safety systems. By converting harmful natural language prompts into formal logical expressions, LogiBreak exploits the distributional gap between alignment data and logic-based inputs, preserving the underlying semantic intent and readability while evading safety constraints. We evaluate LogiBreak on a multilingual jailbreak dataset spanning three languages, demonstrating its effectiveness across various evaluation settings and linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Reasoning: A Survey on Reasoning-based Backdoors in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07697v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of advanced reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. However, although reasoning improves LLMs' performance on downstream tasks, it also introduces new security risks, as adversaries can exploit these capabilities to conduct backdoor attacks. Existing surveys on backdoor attacks and reasoning security offer comprehensive overviews but lack in-depth analysis of backdoor attacks and defenses targeting LLMs' reasoning abilities. In this paper, we take the first step toward providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active. We also present defense strategies against such attacks and discuss current challenges alongside potential directions for future research. This work offers a novel perspective, paving the way for further exploration of secure and trustworthy LLM communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Unlearning Under the Microscope: A Full-Stack View on Methods and Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07626v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families: divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy, offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example, vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks. Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\textit{Agents Under Siege}$: Breaking Pragmatic Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Optimized Prompt Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00218v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most discussions about Large Language Model (LLM) safety have focused on single-agent settings but multi-agent LLM systems now create novel adversarial risks because their behavior depends on communication between agents and decentralized reasoning. In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a $\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses, including variants of $\texttt{Llama-Guard}$ and $\texttt{PromptGuard}$, fail to prohibit our attack, emphasizing the urgent need for multi-agent specific safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Shape of Adversarial Influence: Characterizing LLM Latent Spaces with Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20435v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing interpretability methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often fall short by focusing on linear directions or isolated features, overlooking the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and relational geometry within model representations. This study focuses on how adversarial inputs systematically affect the internal representation spaces of LLMs, a topic which remains poorly understood. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data analysis, as a principled framework to characterize the multi-scale dynamics within LLM activations. Using PH, we systematically analyze six state-of-the-art models under two distinct adversarial conditions, indirect prompt injection and backdoor fine-tuning, and identify a consistent topological signature of adversarial influence. Across architectures and model sizes, adversarial inputs induce ``topological compression'', where the latent space becomes structurally simpler, collapsing from varied, compact, small-scale features into fewer, dominant, and more dispersed large-scale ones. This topological signature is statistically robust across layers, highly discriminative, and provides interpretable insights into how adversarial effects emerge and propagate. By quantifying the shape of activations and neuronal information flow, our architecture-agnostic framework reveals fundamental invariants of representational change, offering a complementary perspective to existing interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |

While MCP enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP clients, attack scripts, and protection mechanisms to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across different hosts and models. In addition, current protection mechanisms have little effect against these attacks. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Lingnan University, Hong Kong.

Large language models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2) The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews. (3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor correction: Fixed sign errors in the results table.

This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains.</p></details> |  |

Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods.

Existing research often depends on conspicuous UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections: malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1) low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3) one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot, keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios (e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate implications for autonomous smartphone operation.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models.

This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint was submitted to IEEE TrustCom 2025.

While modern systems mitigate privacy risks by mapping facial images to embeddings (commonly regarded as privacy-preserving), model inversion attacks reveal that identity information can still be recovered, exposing critical vulnerabilities. However, existing attacks are often computationally expensive and lack generalization, especially those requiring target-specific training. Even training-free approaches suffer from limited identity controllability, hindering faithful reconstruction of nuanced or unseen identities. In this work, we propose DiffMI, the first diffusion-driven, training-free model inversion attack. DiffMI introduces a novel pipeline combining robust latent code initialization, a ranked adversarial refinement strategy, and a statistically grounded, confidence-aware optimization objective. DiffMI applies directly to unseen target identities and face recognition models, offering greater adaptability than training-dependent approaches while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our method achieves 84.42%--92.87% attack success rates against inversion-resilient systems and outperforms the best prior training-free GAN-based approach by 4.01%--9.82%.

| **[Benchmarking Gaslighting Negation Attacks Against Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19017v4)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs. In this paper, we systematically study gaslighting negation attacks: a phenomenon where models, despite initially providing correct answers, are persuaded by user-provided negations to reverse their outputs, often fabricating justifications. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks and observe substantial performance drops when negation is introduced. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA, though even advanced reasoning-oriented models like Gemini-2.5-Pro remain susceptible. Our category-level analysis further shows that subjective or socially nuanced domains (e.g., Social Relation, Image Emotion) are especially fragile, while more objective domains (e.g., Geography) exhibit relatively smaller but still notable drops. Overall, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under gaslighting negation attack. These findings highlight a fundamental robustness gap and provide insights for developing more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

While MCP enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP clients, attack scripts, and protection mechanisms to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across different hosts and models. In addition, current protection mechanisms have little effect against these attacks. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Lingnan University, Hong Kong.

Large language models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2) The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews. (3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor correction: Fixed sign errors in the results table.

This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains.</p></details> |  |

However, current backdoor-based fingerprinting methods face a fundamental trade-off: fingerprints embedded as garbled text are easily detected and filtered, whereas those crafted as coherent natural language are prone to being triggered unintentionally. To overcome these limitations, we propose RFEdit, a knowledge-editing framework that embeds a rule-based multilingual natural language fingerprint (MNLF) by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This approach enables efficient and robust fingerprint injection with minimal impact on unrelated knowledge in LLMs. Our RFEdit framework is further safeguarded by Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT), which mitigates fingerprint degradation during legitimate fine-tuning by restricting parameter updates to the fingerprint subspace. This approach preserves fingerprint integrity while enhancing downstream task performance of LLMs. These advances establish a comprehensive pipeline from fingerprint injection to defense, achieving high detection effectiveness, robustness against adversarial manipulations, harmlessness to model utility, and persistence under fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFEdit maintains robustness under quantization and pruning. Additionally, fingerprint effectiveness is generally improved by more than 10\% when combined with FSFT for math and alpaca downstream tasks.</p></details> | preprint |
