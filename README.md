Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions of Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid LLM-Enhanced Intrusion Detection for Zero-Day Threats in IoT Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07413v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity defences suited for modern connected environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, IEEE conference</p></details> |
| **[Phishing Detection in the Gen-AI Era: Quantized LLMs vs Classical Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07406v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues. We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above 80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into modern cybersecurity frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, IEEE Conference</p></details> |
| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuidedBench: Measuring and Mitigating the Evaluation Discrepancies of In-the-wild LLM Jailbreak Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16903v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the growing interest in jailbreak methods as an effective red-teaming tool for building safe and responsible large language models (LLMs), flawed evaluation system designs have led to significant discrepancies in their effectiveness assessments. We conduct a systematic measurement study based on 37 jailbreak studies since 2022, focusing on both the methods and the evaluation systems they employ. We find that existing evaluation systems lack case-specific criteria, resulting in misleading conclusions about their effectiveness and safety implications. This paper advocates a shift to a more nuanced, case-by-case evaluation paradigm. We introduce GuidedBench, a novel benchmark comprising a curated harmful question dataset, detailed case-by-case evaluation guidelines and an evaluation system integrated with these guidelines -- GuidedEval. Experiments demonstrate that GuidedBench offers more accurate measurements of jailbreak performance, enabling meaningful comparisons across methods and uncovering new insights overlooked in previous evaluations. GuidedEval reduces inter-evaluator variance by at least 76.03\%. Furthermore, we observe that incorporating guidelines can enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak methods themselves, offering new insights into both attack strategies and evaluation paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://sproutnan.github.io/AI-Safety_Benchmark/</p></details> |
| **[Tail-aware Adversarial Attacks: A Distributional Approach to Efficient LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04446v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions. Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[An attention-aware GNN-based input defender against multi-turn jailbreak on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07146v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue, making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are identified. In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking PEFT Limitations: Leveraging Weak-to-Strong Knowledge Transfer for Backdoor Attacks in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17946v4)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning (FPFT). However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from the weak-to-strong based on Feature Alignment-enhanced Knowledge Distillation (FAKD). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through FPFT to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through FAKD, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that FAKD has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of FAKD on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Robustness of Verbal Confidence of LLMs in Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06489v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead to misleading confidence in responses.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed. Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models; no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness, particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility for secure LALMs deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Watermark Stealing Attacks in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07871v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing} attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not} generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless} watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and model this threat via security games.</p></details> |  |
| **["I am bad": Interpreting Stealthy, Universal and Robust Audio Jailbreaks in Audio-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00718v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of multimodal large language models has introduced innovative human-machine interaction paradigms but also significant challenges in machine learning safety. Audio-Language Models (ALMs) are especially relevant due to the intuitive nature of spoken communication, yet little is known about their failure modes. This paper explores audio jailbreaks targeting ALMs, focusing on their ability to bypass alignment mechanisms. We construct adversarial perturbations that generalize across prompts, tasks, and even base audio samples, demonstrating the first universal jailbreaks in the audio modality, and show that these remain effective in simulated real-world conditions. Beyond demonstrating attack feasibility, we analyze how ALMs interpret these audio adversarial examples and reveal them to encode imperceptible first-person toxic speech - suggesting that the most effective perturbations for eliciting toxic outputs specifically embed linguistic features within the audio signal. These results have important implications for understanding the interactions between different modalities in multimodal models, and offer actionable insights for enhancing defenses against adversarial audio attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardVal: Dynamic Large Language Model Jailbreak Evaluation for Comprehensive Safety Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07735v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities. Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform future research and drive the development of more secure models.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[One Object, Multiple Lies: A Benchmark for Cross-task Adversarial Attack on Unified Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07709v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress, enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARBoids: Adaptive Residual Reinforcement Learning With Boids Model for Cooperative Multi-USV Target Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18549v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a comparative evaluation of traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues. We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above 80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into modern cybersecurity frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, IEEE Conference</p></details> |
| **[BarkBeetle: Stealing Decision Tree Models with Fault Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06986v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models, particularly decision trees (DTs), are widely adopted across various domains due to their interpretability and efficiency. However, as ML models become increasingly integrated into privacy-sensitive applications, concerns about their confidentiality have grown, particularly in light of emerging threats such as model extraction and fault injection attacks. Assessing the vulnerability of DTs under such attacks is therefore important. In this work, we present BarkBeetle, a novel attack that leverages fault injection to extract internal structural information of DT models. BarkBeetle employs a bottom-up recovery strategy that uses targeted fault injection at specific nodes to efficiently infer feature splits and threshold values. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that BarkBeetle requires significantly fewer queries and recovers more structural information compared to prior approaches, when evaluated on DTs trained with public UCI datasets. To validate its practical feasibility, we implement BarkBeetle on a Raspberry Pi RP2350 board and perform fault injections using the Faultier voltage glitching tool. As BarkBeetle targets general DT models, we also provide an in-depth discussion on its applicability to a broader range of tree-based applications, including data stream classification, DT variants, and cryptography schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating and Improving Robustness in Large Language Models: A Survey and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11111v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution (OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community. Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1) Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide an easy-to-search project (https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the community.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |

Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions of Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Robustness of Large Audio Language Models to Audio Injection: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19598v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, yet their robustness against malicious audio injection attacks remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed. Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models; no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness, particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility for secure LALMs deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Watermark Stealing Attacks in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07871v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing} attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not} generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless} watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and model this threat via security games.</p></details> |  |
| **["I am bad": Interpreting Stealthy, Universal and Robust Audio Jailbreaks in Audio-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00718v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of multimodal large language models has introduced innovative human-machine interaction paradigms but also significant challenges in machine learning safety. Audio-Language Models (ALMs) are especially relevant due to the intuitive nature of spoken communication, yet little is known about their failure modes. This paper explores audio jailbreaks targeting ALMs, focusing on their ability to bypass alignment mechanisms. We construct adversarial perturbations that generalize across prompts, tasks, and even base audio samples, demonstrating the first universal jailbreaks in the audio modality, and show that these remain effective in simulated real-world conditions. Beyond demonstrating attack feasibility, we analyze how ALMs interpret these audio adversarial examples and reveal them to encode imperceptible first-person toxic speech - suggesting that the most effective perturbations for eliciting toxic outputs specifically embed linguistic features within the audio signal. These results have important implications for understanding the interactions between different modalities in multimodal models, and offer actionable insights for enhancing defenses against adversarial audio attacks.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities. Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol.

| **[Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13206v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive ("I'll trick the user..."), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations ("Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe..."). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment. We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.</p></details> |  |
