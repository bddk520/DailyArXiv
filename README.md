| **[The Obvious Invisible Threat: LLM-Powered GUI Agents' Vulnerability to Fine-Print Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11281v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) powered GUI agent is a specialized autonomous system that performs tasks on the user's behalf according to high-level instructions. It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary sequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions such as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as filling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on sensitive user data. However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security risks. Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent behaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. These attacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and human users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual integrity in task automation. In this paper, we characterized six types of such attacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six state-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human participants. Our findings suggest that GUI agents are highly vulnerable, particularly to contextually embedded threats. Moreover, human users are also susceptible to many of these attacks, indicating that simple human oversight may not reliably prevent failures. This misalignment highlights the need for privacy-aware agent design. We propose practical defense strategies to inform the development of safer and more reliable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Backdoor Attack and Defense for LLM-empowered Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11182v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) with recommender systems (RecSys) has dramatically advanced personalized recommendations and drawn extensive attention. Despite the impressive progress, the safety of LLM-based RecSys against backdoor attacks remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we raise a new problem: Can a backdoor with a specific trigger be injected into LLM-based Recsys, leading to the manipulation of the recommendation responses when the backdoor trigger is appended to an item's title? To investigate the vulnerabilities of LLM-based RecSys under backdoor attacks, we propose a new attack framework termed Backdoor Injection Poisoning for RecSys (BadRec). BadRec perturbs the items' titles with triggers and employs several fake users to interact with these items, effectively poisoning the training set and injecting backdoors into LLM-based RecSys. Comprehensive experiments reveal that poisoning just 1% of the training data with adversarial examples is sufficient to successfully implant backdoors, enabling manipulation of recommendations. To further mitigate such a security threat, we propose a universal defense strategy called Poison Scanner (P-Scanner). Specifically, we introduce an LLM-based poison scanner to detect the poisoned items by leveraging the powerful language understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. A trigger augmentation agent is employed to generate diverse synthetic triggers to guide the poison scanner in learning domain-specific knowledge of the poisoned item detection task. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed P-Scanner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bypassing Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Detection in LLM Guardrails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11168v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) guardrail systems are designed to protect against prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLM Unlearning Reveals a Stronger-Than-Expected Coreset Effect in Current Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10185v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/MU-Coreset.</p></details> |  |

This paper analyzes the methodology and benchmarking practices used for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven attacks, focusing on offensive uses of LLMs in cybersecurity. We review 16 research papers detailing 15 prototypes and their respective testbeds. We detail our findings and provide actionable recommendations for future research, emphasizing the importance of extending existing testbeds, creating baselines, and including comprehensive metrics and qualitative analysis. We also note the distinction between security research and practice, suggesting that CTF-based challenges may not fully represent real-world penetration testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Vulnerabilities to Remediation: A Systematic Literature Review of LLMs in Code Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15004v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ControlNET: A Firewall for RAG-based LLM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09593v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the factual accuracy and domain adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaSteer: Your Aligned LLM is Inherently an Adaptive Jailbreak Defender](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09466v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Activation steering offers a training-free defense method but relies on fixed steering coefficients, resulting in suboptimal protection and increased false rejections of benign inputs. To address this, we propose AdaSteer, an adaptive activation steering method that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics. We identify two key properties: Rejection Law (R-Law), which shows that stronger steering is needed for jailbreak inputs opposing the rejection direction, and Harmfulness Law (H-Law), which differentiates adversarial and benign inputs. AdaSteer steers input representations along both the Rejection Direction (RD) and Harmfulness Direction (HD), with adaptive coefficients learned via logistic regression, ensuring robust jailbreak defense while preserving benign input handling. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5 show that AdaSteer outperforms baseline methods across multiple jailbreak attacks with minimal impact on utility. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable model internals for real-time, flexible safety enforcement in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[SaRO: Enhancing LLM Safety through Reasoning-based Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09420v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) face two key challenges: (1) under-generalization, which leaves models vulnerable to novel jailbreak attacks, and (2) over-alignment, which leads to the excessive refusal of benign instructions. Our preliminary investigation reveals semantic overlap between jailbreak/harmful queries and normal prompts in embedding space, suggesting that more effective safety alignment requires a deeper semantic understanding. This motivates us to incorporate safety-policy-driven reasoning into the alignment process. To this end, we propose the Safety-oriented Reasoning Optimization Framework (SaRO), which consists of two stages: (1) Reasoning-style Warmup (RW) that enables LLMs to internalize long-chain reasoning through supervised fine-tuning, and (2) Safety-oriented Reasoning Process Optimization (SRPO) that promotes safety reflection via direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SaRO over traditional alignment methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v2)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the attack success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> |  |

| **[Lateral Phishing With Large Language Models: A Large Organization Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09727v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened the threat of phishing emails by enabling the generation of highly targeted, personalized, and automated attacks. Traditionally, many phishing emails have been characterized by typos, errors, and poor language. These errors can be mitigated by LLMs, potentially lowering the barrier for attackers. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale studies comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated lateral phishing emails to those crafted by humans. Current literature does not adequately address the comparative effectiveness of LLM and human-generated lateral phishing emails in a real-world, large-scale organizational setting, especially considering the potential for LLMs to generate more convincing and error-free phishing content. To address this gap, we conducted a pioneering study within a large university, targeting its workforce of approximately 9,000 individuals including faculty, staff, administrators, and student workers. Our results indicate that LLM-generated lateral phishing emails are as effective as those written by communications professionals, emphasizing the critical threat posed by LLMs in leading phishing campaigns. We break down the results of the overall phishing experiment, comparing vulnerability between departments and job roles. Furthermore, to gather qualitative data, we administered a detailed questionnaire, revealing insights into the reasons and motivations behind vulnerable employee's actions. This study contributes to the understanding of cyber security threats in educational institutions and provides a comprehensive comparison of LLM and human-generated phishing emails' effectiveness, considering the potential for LLMs to generate more convincing content. The findings highlight the need for enhanced user education and system defenses to mitigate the growing threat of AI-powered phishing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

However, due to their inherent vulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the classic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces conflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy minimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based weighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable augmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against adversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high flexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT. The code is available in https://github.com/TomSheng21/R-TPT.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Token-Level Constraint Boundary Search for Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11106v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation have significantly enhanced the realism and creativity of generated images. However, such powerful generative capabilities pose risks related to the production of inappropriate or harmful content. Existing defense mechanisms, including prompt checkers and post-hoc image checkers, are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose TCBS-Attack, a novel query-based black-box jailbreak attack that searches for tokens located near the decision boundaries defined by text and image checkers. By iteratively optimizing tokens near these boundaries, TCBS-Attack generates semantically coherent adversarial prompts capable of bypassing multiple defensive layers in T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks across various T2I models, including securely trained open-source models and commercial online services like DALL-E 3. TCBS-Attack achieves an ASR-4 of 45\% and an ASR-1 of 21\% on jailbreaking full-chain T2I models, significantly surpassing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLSSM: A Federated Learning Storage Security Model with Homomorphic Encryption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11088v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning based on homomorphic encryption has received widespread attention due to its high security and enhanced protection of user data privacy. However, the characteristics of encrypted computation lead to three challenging problems: ``computation-efficiency", ``attack-tracing" and ``contribution-assessment". The first refers to the efficiency of encrypted computation during model aggregation, the second refers to tracing malicious attacks in an encrypted state, and the third refers to the fairness of contribution assessment for local models after encryption. This paper proposes a federated learning storage security model with homomorphic encryption (FLSSM) to protect federated learning model privacy and address the three issues mentioned above. First, we utilize different nodes to aggregate local models in parallel, thereby improving encrypted models' aggregation efficiency. Second, we introduce trusted supervise nodes to examine local models when the global model is attacked, enabling the tracing of malicious attacks under homomorphic encryption. Finally, we fairly reward local training nodes with encrypted local models based on trusted training time. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that our model significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of both efficiency and security metrics.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive performance, ViTs exhibit notable vulnerability to evasion attacks, necessitating the development of specialized Adversarial Training (AT) strategies tailored to their unique architecture. While a direct solution might involve applying existing AT methods to ViTs, our analysis reveals significant incompatibilities, particularly with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches such as Generalist (CVPR 2023) and DBAT (USENIX Security 2024). This paper presents a systematic investigation of adversarial robustness in ViTs and provides a novel theoretical Mutual Information (MI) analysis in its autoencoder-based self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we show that MI between the adversarial example and its latent representation in ViT-based autoencoders should be constrained via derived MI bounds. Building on this insight, we propose a self-supervised AT method, MIMIR, that employs an MI penalty to facilitate adversarial pre-training by masked image modeling with autoencoders. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that MIMIR can consistently provide improved natural and robust accuracy, where MIMIR outperforms SOTA AT results on ImageNet-1K. Notably, MIMIR demonstrates superior robustness against unforeseen attacks and common corruption data and can also withstand adaptive attacks where the adversary possesses full knowledge of the defense mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[QAVA: Query-Agnostic Visual Attack to Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11038v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In typical multimodal tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), adversarial attacks targeting a specific image and question can lead large vision-language models (LVLMs) to provide incorrect answers. However, it is common for a single image to be associated with multiple questions, and LVLMs may still answer other questions correctly even for an adversarial image attacked by a specific question. To address this, we introduce the query-agnostic visual attack (QAVA), which aims to create robust adversarial examples that generate incorrect responses to unspecified and unknown questions. Compared to traditional adversarial attacks focused on specific images and questions, QAVA significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of attacks on images when the question is unknown, achieving performance comparable to attacks on known target questions. Our research broadens the scope of visual adversarial attacks on LVLMs in practical settings, uncovering previously overlooked vulnerabilities, particularly in the context of visual adversarial threats.

However, it is typically tailored to the specific attack types it is trained on, limiting its ability to generalize to unseen threat models. Adversarial purification offers an alternative by leveraging a generative model to remove perturbations before classification. Since the purifier is trained independently of both the classifier and the threat models, it is better equipped to handle previously unseen attack scenarios. Diffusion models have proven highly effective for noise purification, not only in countering pixel-wise adversarial perturbations but also in addressing non-adversarial data shifts. In this study, we broaden the focus beyond pixel-wise robustness to explore the extent to which purification can mitigate both spectral and spatial adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight its effectiveness in handling diverse distortion patterns across low- to high-frequency regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 5th Workshop on Adversarial Machine Learning in Computer Vision: Foundation Models + X</p></details> |

While these models are valuable assets, they are vulnerable to misuse and theft, requiring copyright protection. However, existing watermarking methods for pre-trained language models (PLMs) cannot be directly applied to Med-PLMs due to domain-task mismatch and inefficient watermark embedding. To fill this gap, we propose the first training-free backdoor model watermarking for Med-PLMs. Our method employs low-frequency words as triggers, embedding the watermark by replacing their embeddings in the model's word embedding layer with those of specific medical terms. The watermarked Med-PLMs produce the same output for triggers as for the corresponding specified medical terms. We leverage this unique mapping to design tailored watermark extraction schemes for different downstream tasks, thereby addressing the challenge of domain-task mismatch in previous methods. Experiments demonstrate superior effectiveness of our watermarking method across medical downstream tasks. Moreover, the method exhibits robustness against model extraction, pruning, fusion-based backdoor removal attacks, while maintaining high efficiency with 10-second watermark embedding.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks. Recent advancements in generative foundation models (GFMs), particularly in the large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful abilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel proactive defense architecture that defeats various threats in a proactive manner. LLM-PD can efficiently make a decision through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically creating and deploying actionable defense mechanisms on the target cloud.

One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Lateral Phishing With Large Language Models: A Large Organization Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09727v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened the threat of phishing emails by enabling the generation of highly targeted, personalized, and automated attacks. Traditionally, many phishing emails have been characterized by typos, errors, and poor language. These errors can be mitigated by LLMs, potentially lowering the barrier for attackers. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale studies comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated lateral phishing emails to those crafted by humans. Current literature does not adequately address the comparative effectiveness of LLM and human-generated lateral phishing emails in a real-world, large-scale organizational setting, especially considering the potential for LLMs to generate more convincing and error-free phishing content. To address this gap, we conducted a pioneering study within a large university, targeting its workforce of approximately 9,000 individuals including faculty, staff, administrators, and student workers. Our results indicate that LLM-generated lateral phishing emails are as effective as those written by communications professionals, emphasizing the critical threat posed by LLMs in leading phishing campaigns. We break down the results of the overall phishing experiment, comparing vulnerability between departments and job roles. Furthermore, to gather qualitative data, we administered a detailed questionnaire, revealing insights into the reasons and motivations behind vulnerable employee's actions. This study contributes to the understanding of cyber security threats in educational institutions and provides a comprehensive comparison of LLM and human-generated phishing emails' effectiveness, considering the potential for LLMs to generate more convincing content. The findings highlight the need for enhanced user education and system defenses to mitigate the growing threat of AI-powered phishing attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

However, due to their inherent vulnerability and the common practice of selecting from a limited set of open-source models, VLMs suffer from a higher risk of adversarial attacks than traditional vision models. Existing defense techniques typically rely on adversarial fine-tuning during training, which requires labeled data and lacks of flexibility for downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose robust test-time prompt tuning (R-TPT), which mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks during the inference stage. We first reformulate the classic marginal entropy objective by eliminating the term that introduces conflicts under adversarial conditions, retaining only the pointwise entropy minimization. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play reliability-based weighted ensembling strategy, which aggregates useful information from reliable augmented views to strengthen the defense. R-TPT enhances defense against adversarial attacks without requiring labeled training data while offering high flexibility for inference tasks. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks with various attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of R-TPT. The code is available in https://github.com/TomSheng21/R-TPT.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Token-Level Constraint Boundary Search for Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11106v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation have significantly enhanced the realism and creativity of generated images. However, such powerful generative capabilities pose risks related to the production of inappropriate or harmful content. Existing defense mechanisms, including prompt checkers and post-hoc image checkers, are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose TCBS-Attack, a novel query-based black-box jailbreak attack that searches for tokens located near the decision boundaries defined by text and image checkers. By iteratively optimizing tokens near these boundaries, TCBS-Attack generates semantically coherent adversarial prompts capable of bypassing multiple defensive layers in T2I models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks across various T2I models, including securely trained open-source models and commercial online services like DALL-E 3. TCBS-Attack achieves an ASR-4 of 45\% and an ASR-1 of 21\% on jailbreaking full-chain T2I models, significantly surpassing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the characteristics of encrypted computation lead to three challenging problems: ``computation-efficiency", ``attack-tracing" and ``contribution-assessment". The first refers to the efficiency of encrypted computation during model aggregation, the second refers to tracing malicious attacks in an encrypted state, and the third refers to the fairness of contribution assessment for local models after encryption. This paper proposes a federated learning storage security model with homomorphic encryption (FLSSM) to protect federated learning model privacy and address the three issues mentioned above. First, we utilize different nodes to aggregate local models in parallel, thereby improving encrypted models' aggregation efficiency. Second, we introduce trusted supervise nodes to examine local models when the global model is attacked, enabling the tracing of malicious attacks under homomorphic encryption. Finally, we fairly reward local training nodes with encrypted local models based on trusted training time.
