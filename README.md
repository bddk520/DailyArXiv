| **[Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM Generated Reviews of Scientific Publications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10248v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Between a Rock and a Hard Place: Exploiting Ethical Reasoning to Jailbreak LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05367v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy Risks of LLM-Empowered Recommender Systems: An Inversion Attack Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03703v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65 percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87 percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM RecSys 2025 (10 pages, 4 figures)</p></details> |
| **[When Your Reviewer is an LLM: Biases, Divergence, and Prompt Injection Risks in Peer Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09912v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peer review is the cornerstone of academic publishing, yet the process is increasingly strained by rising submission volumes, reviewer overload, and expertise mismatches. Large language models (LLMs) are now being used as "reviewer aids," raising concerns about their fairness, consistency, and robustness against indirect prompt injection attacks. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs as academic reviewers. Using a curated dataset of 1,441 papers from ICLR 2023 and NeurIPS 2022, we evaluate GPT-5-mini against human reviewers across ratings, strengths, and weaknesses. The evaluation employs structured prompting with reference paper calibration, topic modeling, and similarity analysis to compare review content. We further embed covert instructions into PDF submissions to assess LLMs' susceptibility to prompt injection. Our findings show that LLMs consistently inflate ratings for weaker papers while aligning more closely with human judgments on stronger contributions. Moreover, while overarching malicious prompts induce only minor shifts in topical focus, explicitly field-specific instructions successfully manipulate specific aspects of LLM-generated reviews. This study underscores both the promises and perils of integrating LLMs into peer review and points to the importance of designing safeguards that ensure integrity and trust in future review processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering MoE LLMs via Expert (De)Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09660v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts. We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to +20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by -41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden within experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise penetration-testing is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. We introduce a novel prototype designed to employ LLMs to autonomously perform Assumed Breach penetration-testing against enterprise networks. Our system represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft Active Directory testbed, GOAD. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks (e.g., web-app audits, social engineering, and unstructured data analysis for credentials), and generate scenario-specific attack parameters like realistic password candidates. The prototype exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. We find that the associated costs are competitive with, and often significantly lower than, those incurred by professional human pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Character-Level Perturbations Disrupt LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09112v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries. To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACE: A Security Architecture for LLM-Integrated App Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20984v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated app systems extend the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) with third-party apps that are invoked by a system LLM using interleaved planning and execution phases to answer user queries. These systems introduce new attack vectors where malicious apps can cause integrity violation of planning or execution, availability breakdown, or privacy compromise during execution. In this work, we identify new attacks impacting the integrity of planning, as well as the integrity and availability of execution in LLM-integrated apps, and demonstrate them against IsolateGPT, a recent solution designed to mitigate attacks from malicious apps. We propose Abstract-Concrete-Execute (ACE), a new secure architecture for LLM-integrated app systems that provides security guarantees for system planning and execution. Specifically, ACE decouples planning into two phases by first creating an abstract execution plan using only trusted information, and then mapping the abstract plan to a concrete plan using installed system apps. We verify that the plans generated by our system satisfy user-specified secure information flow constraints via static analysis on the structured plan output. During execution, ACE enforces data and capability barriers between apps, and ensures that the execution is conducted according to the trusted abstract plan. We show experimentally that ACE is secure against attacks from the InjecAgent and Agent Security Bench benchmarks for indirect prompt injection, and our newly introduced attacks. We also evaluate the utility of ACE in realistic environments, using the Tool Usage suite from the LangChain benchmark. Our architecture represents a significant advancement towards hardening LLM-based systems using system security principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables; accepted by Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08646v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become increasingly capable of automating complex, multi-step tasks, the need for robust, secure, and predictable architectural patterns is paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to the ``Plan-then-Execute'' (P-t-E) pattern, an agentic design that separates strategic planning from tactical execution. We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects, developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient, and trustworthy LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Language Model Can Secretly Write Like Humans: Contrastive Paraphrase Attacks on LLM-Generated Text Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15337v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP-2025</p></details> |

| **[Attacking Attention of Foundation Models Disrupts Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05394v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Foundation models are large models, trained on broad data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers (ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications. However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification, captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

| **[Bayesian Semiparametric Joint Modeling of Gap-Time Distribution for Multitype Recurrent Events and a Terminal Event](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10354v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical settings, multitype recurrent events such as stroke and heart failure occur frequently, often concluding with a terminal event such as death. Understanding the links between these recurring and terminal events is fundamental to developing interventions that delay detrimental outcomes. Joint modeling is needed to quantify the dependence between event types and between recurrent events and mortality. We propose a Bayesian semiparametric joint model on the gap-time scale for multitype recurrent events and a terminal event. The model includes a shared frailty that links all recurrent types and the terminal event. Each baseline hazard is assigned a gamma-process prior, while regression and frailty parameters receive standard parametric priors. This ensures flexible baselines and familiar effect measures. The construction gives closed-form expressions for the cumulative hazard and frailty component and connects to Breslow-Aalen type estimators as a special case of our estimator, linking the Bayesian procedure to the classical approach. Computationally, we develop a simple MCMC sampler that avoids large matrix factorizations and scales nearly linearly in sample size. A comprehensive simulation evaluates four criteria: accuracy, prediction, robustness, and computation. There is no exact frequentist version of our specification; for comparison, we fit the same model with an EM algorithm in a frequentist framework.

| **[Attacking Attention of Foundation Models Disrupts Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05394v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Foundation models are large models, trained on broad data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers (ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications. However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification, captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

| **[Bayesian Semiparametric Joint Modeling of Gap-Time Distribution for Multitype Recurrent Events and a Terminal Event](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10354v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical settings, multitype recurrent events such as stroke and heart failure occur frequently, often concluding with a terminal event such as death. Understanding the links between these recurring and terminal events is fundamental to developing interventions that delay detrimental outcomes. Joint modeling is needed to quantify the dependence between event types and between recurrent events and mortality. We propose a Bayesian semiparametric joint model on the gap-time scale for multitype recurrent events and a terminal event. The model includes a shared frailty that links all recurrent types and the terminal event. Each baseline hazard is assigned a gamma-process prior, while regression and frailty parameters receive standard parametric priors. This ensures flexible baselines and familiar effect measures. The construction gives closed-form expressions for the cumulative hazard and frailty component and connects to Breslow-Aalen type estimators as a special case of our estimator, linking the Bayesian procedure to the classical approach. Computationally, we develop a simple MCMC sampler that avoids large matrix factorizations and scales nearly linearly in sample size. A comprehensive simulation evaluates four criteria: accuracy, prediction, robustness, and computation. There is no exact frequentist version of our specification; for comparison, we fit the same model with an EM algorithm in a frequentist framework. Our model and MCMC algorithm demonstrate superior performance on each criterion. We illustrate the approach with data from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), jointly analyzing acute and chronic cardiovascular recurrences and death.</p></details> |  |

We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

| **[MoLEx: Mixture of LoRA Experts in Speech Self-Supervised Models for Audio Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09175v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While self-supervised learning (SSL)-based models have boosted audio deepfake detection accuracy, fully finetuning them is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient framework that combines Low-Rank Adaptation with a Mixture-of-Experts router, called Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLEx). It preserves pre-trained knowledge of SSL models while efficiently finetuning only selected experts, reducing training costs while maintaining robust performance. The observed utility of experts during inference shows the router reactivates the same experts for similar attacks but switches to other experts for novel spoofs, confirming MoLEx's domain-aware adaptability. MoLEx additionally offers flexibility for domain adaptation by allowing extra experts to be trained without modifying the entire model. We mainly evaluate our approach on the ASVSpoof 5 dataset and achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) equal error rate (EER) of 5.56% on the evaluation set without augmentation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SimMark, a robust sentence-level watermarking algorithm that makes LLMs' outputs traceable without requiring access to model internals, making it compatible with both open and API-based LLMs. By leveraging the similarity of semantic sentence embeddings combined with rejection sampling to embed detectable statistical patterns imperceptible to humans, and employing a soft counting mechanism, SimMark achieves robustness against paraphrasing attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that SimMark sets a new benchmark for robust watermarking of LLM-generated content, surpassing prior sentence-level watermarking techniques in robustness, sampling efficiency, and applicability across diverse domains, all while maintaining the text quality and fluency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 25 main</p></details> |
| **[Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results.

| **[Securing Cryptographic Software via Typed Assembly Language (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08727v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Authors of cryptographic software are well aware that their code should not leak secrets through its timing behavior, and, until 2018, they believed that following industry-standard constant-time coding guidelines was sufficient. However, the revelation of the Spectre family of speculative execution attacks injected new complexities. To block speculative attacks, prior work has proposed annotating the program's source code to mark secret data, with hardware using this information to decide when to speculate (i.e., when only public values are involved) or not (when secrets are in play). While these solutions are able to track secret information stored on the heap, they suffer from limitations that prevent them from correctly tracking secrets on the stack, at a cost in performance. This paper introduces SecSep, a transformation framework that rewrites assembly programs so that they partition secret and public data on the stack. By moving from the source-code level to assembly rewriting, SecSep is able to address limitations of prior work. The key challenge in performing this assembly rewriting stems from the loss of semantic information through the lengthy compilation process. The key innovation of our methodology is a new variant of typed assembly language (TAL), Octal, which allows us to address this challenge. Assembly rewriting is driven by compile-time inference within Octal. We apply our technique to cryptographic programs and demonstrate that it enables secure speculation efficiently, incurring a low average overhead of $1.2\%$.</p></details> |  |
