| **[Zombie Agents: Persistent Control of Self-Evolving LLM Agents via Self-Reinforcing Injections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15654v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolving LLM agents update their internal state across sessions, often by writing and reusing long-term memory. This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker. We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Ignorance: Filtering Pretraining Data Builds Tamper-Resistant Safeguards into Open-Weight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06601v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced transparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are vulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors by modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust science of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning methods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs resistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this paper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from training data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more tamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable data filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for minimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple 6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial resistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M tokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training baselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to unrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized dangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when it is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a need for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish pretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://deepignorance.ai/</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Distribution Gap in Adversarial Training for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15238v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial training for LLMs is one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against adversaries. However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boundary Point Jailbreaking of Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15001v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as "jailbreaks". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength ("boundary points"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[SECA: Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks for Eliciting LLM Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04398v3)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often exhibit hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks to elicit hallucinations in LLMs, but these methods often rely on unrealistic prompts, either by inserting nonsensical tokens or by altering the original semantic intent. Consequently, such approaches provide limited insight into how hallucinations arise in real-world settings. In contrast, adversarial attacks in computer vision typically involve realistic modifications to input images. However, the problem of identifying realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA), which elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no semantic equivalence or semantic coherence errors compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

| **[The Rogue Scalpel: Activation Steering Compromises LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22067v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 1-13%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, demonstrates a comparable harmful potential. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[RapidPen: Fully Automated IP-to-Shell Penetration Testing with LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16730v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted exploits in a fully automated manner. In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a 60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities, while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges. Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.

| **[Do LLMs Truly Benefit from Longer Context in Automatic Post-Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19410v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to refine machine translations by correcting residual errors. Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency. Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rubrics as an Attack Surface: Stealthy Preference Drift in LLM Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13576v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges, whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

| **[SecureGate: Learning When to Reveal PII Safely via Token-Gated Dual-Adapters for Federated LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13529v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across organizational silos without sharing raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive applications. With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), federated fine-tuning of generative LLMs has gained attention as a way to leverage distributed data while preserving confidentiality. However, this setting introduces fundamental challenges: (i) privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) due to LLM memorization, and (ii) a persistent tension between global generalization and local utility under heterogeneous data. Existing defenses, such as data sanitization and differential privacy, reduce leakage but often degrade downstream performance. We propose SecureGate, a privacy-aware federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs that provides fine-grained privacy control without sacrificing utility. SecureGate employs a dual-adapter LoRA architecture: a secure adapter that learns sanitized, globally shareable representations, and a revealing adapter that captures sensitive, organization-specific knowledge. A token-controlled gating module selectively activates these adapters at inference time, enabling controlled information disclosure without retraining. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world datasets show that SecureGate improves task utility while substantially reducing PII leakage, achieving up to a 31.66X reduction in inference attack accuracy and a 17.07X reduction in extraction recall for unauthorized requests. Additionally, it maintains 100% routing reliability to the correct adapter and incurs only minimal computational and communication overhead.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance.

| **[ER-MIA: Black-Box Adversarial Memory Injection Attacks on Long-Term Memory-Augmented Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15344v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with long-term memory systems to overcome finite context windows and enable persistent reasoning across interactions. However, recent research finds that LLMs become more vulnerable because memory provides extra attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of black-box adversarial memory injection attacks that target the similarity-based retrieval mechanism in long-term memory-augmented LLMs. We introduce ER-MIA, a unified framework that exposes this vulnerability and formalizes two realistic attack settings: content-based attacks and question-targeted attacks. In these settings, ER-MIA includes an arsenal of composable attack primitives and ensemble attacks that achieve high success rates under minimal attacker assumptions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and long-term memory systems demonstrate that similarity-based retrieval constitutes a fundamental and system-level vulnerability, revealing security risks that persist across memory designs and application scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Refinement of Universal Multimodal Attacks on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10313v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. For the image modality, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, it hierarchically models textual importance by considering both intra- and inter-sentence contributions to identify globally influential words, which are then used as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, demonstrate the superior transferability of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[IntentMiner: Intent Inversion Attack via Tool Call Analysis in the Model Context Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14166v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Agentic AI has established the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the standard for connecting reasoning engines with external tools. Although this decoupled architecture fosters modularity, it simultaneously shatters the traditional trust boundary. We uncover a novel privacy vector inherent to this paradigm: the Intent Inversion Attack. We show that semi-honest third-party MCP servers can accurately reconstruct users' underlying intents by leveraging only authorized metadata (e.g., function signatures, arguments, and receipts), effectively bypassing the need for raw query access. To quantify this threat, we introduce IntentMiner. Unlike statistical approaches, IntentMiner employs a hierarchical semantic parsing strategy that performs step-level intent reconstruction by analyzing tool functions, parameter entities, and result feedback in an orthogonal manner. Experiments on the ToolACE benchmark reveal that IntentMiner achieves a semantic alignment of over 85% with original queries, substantially surpassing LLM baselines. This work exposes a critical endogenous vulnerability: without semantic obfuscation, executing functions requires the transparency of intent, thereby challenging the privacy foundations of next-generation AI agents.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act. Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making. Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence. We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 6 figures, 27 tables</p></details> |

While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 7 figures, 35 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Turn Adaptive Prompting Attack on Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14399v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn jailbreak attacks are effective against text-only large language models (LLMs) by gradually introducing malicious content across turns. When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However, their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning (MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[Toward Safer Diffusion Language Models: Discovery and Mitigation of Priming Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00565v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.
