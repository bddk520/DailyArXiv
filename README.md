Existing approaches often explore the adversarial space poorly, rely on hand-crafted heuristics, or lack systematic query refinement. We present NEXUS (Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences), a modular framework for constructing, refining, and executing optimized multi-turn attacks. NEXUS comprises: (1) ThoughtNet, which hierarchically expands a harmful intent into a structured semantic network of topics, entities, and query chains; (2) a feedback-driven Simulator that iteratively refines and prunes these chains through attacker-victim-judge LLM collaboration using harmfulness and semantic-similarity benchmarks; and (3) a Network Traverser that adaptively navigates the refined query space for real-time attacks. This pipeline uncovers stealthy, high-success adversarial paths across LLMs. On several closed-source and open-source LLMs, NEXUS increases attack success rate by 2.1% to 19.4% over prior methods.

We present DeepTx, a real-time transaction analysis system that detects such threats before user confirmation. DeepTx simulates pending transactions, extracts behavior, context, and UI features, and uses multiple large language models (LLMs) to reason about transaction intent. A consensus mechanism with self-reflection ensures robust and explainable decisions. Evaluated on our phishing dataset, DeepTx achieves high precision and recall (demo video: https://youtu.be/4OfK9KCEXUM).</p></details> | Accepted to ASE'25 |
| **[The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM Serving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20002v5)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was first submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

| **[Genesis: Evolving Attack Strategies for LLM Web Agent Red-Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18314v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks, they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks. However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis, a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently outperforms existing attack baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which are not designed for dynamic systems, especially for dynamic memory states of LLM agents. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial recommenders. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Any-Depth Alignment: Unlocking Innate Safety Alignment of LLMs to Any-Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18081v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).</p></details> |  |
| **[Echoes of Human Malice in Agents: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Turn Online Harassment Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14207v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Is Multilingual LLM Watermarking Truly Multilingual? A Simple Back-Translation Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18019v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17 languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking across diverse languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00161v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution. In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision. For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.</p></details> |  |
| **[OCR-APT: Reconstructing APT Stories from Audit Logs using Subgraph Anomaly Detection and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15188v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy cyberattacks that often evade detection in system-level audit logs. Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' extended version of the paper accepted for publication at the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025).

We introduce HarmNet, a modular framework comprising ThoughtNet, a hierarchical semantic network; a feedback-driven Simulator for iterative query refinement; and a Network Traverser for real-time adaptive attack execution. HarmNet systematically explores and refines the adversarial space to uncover stealthy, high-success attack paths.

Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive electronic health record (EHR) data improves domain alignment but also raises the risk of exposing patient information through model behaviors. In this work-in-progress, we present an exploratory empirical study on membership inference vulnerabilities in clinical LLMs, focusing on whether adversaries can infer if specific patient records were used during model training. Using a state-of-the-art clinical question-answering model, Llemr, we evaluate both canonical loss-based attacks and a domain-motivated paraphrasing-based perturbation strategy that more realistically reflects clinical adversarial conditions. Our preliminary findings reveal limited but measurable membership leakage, suggesting that current clinical LLMs provide partial resistance yet remain susceptible to subtle privacy risks that could undermine trust in clinical AI adoption. These results motivate continued development of context-aware, domain-specific privacy evaluations and defenses such as differential privacy fine-tuning and paraphrase-aware training, to strengthen the security and trustworthiness of healthcare AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st IEEE Workshop on Healthcare and Medical Device Security, Privacy, Resilience, and Trust (IEEE HMD-SPiRiT)</p></details> |

Followed by over 23.8 million users, these channels share a wide array of malicious and unethical content with their subscribers, including compromised credentials, pirated software and media, social media manipulation tools, and blackhat hacking resources such as malware, exploit kits, and social engineering scams. To evaluate these channels, we developed DarkGram, a BERT-based framework that automatically identifies malicious posts from the CACs with an accuracy of 96%. Using DarkGram, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 53,605 posts shared on these channels between February and May 2024, revealing key characteristics of the content. While much of this content is distributed for free, channel administrators frequently employ strategies such as promotions and giveaways to engage users and boost the sales of premium cybercriminal content. Interestingly, these channels sometimes pose significant risks to their own subscribers. Notably, 28.1% of the links shared in these channels contained phishing attacks, and 38% of executable files were bundled with malware. Analyzing how subscribers consume and positively react to the shared content paints a dangerous picture of the perpetuation of cybercriminal content at scale. We also found that the CACs can evade scrutiny or platform takedowns by quickly migrating to new channels with minimal subscriber loss, highlighting the resilience of this ecosystem. To counteract this, we utilized DarkGram to detect emerging channels and reported malicious content to Telegram and affected organizations. This resulted in the takedown of 196 channels over three months. Our findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated efforts to combat the growing threats posed by these channels. To aid this effort, we open-source our dataset and the DarkGram framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |

However, their widespread deployment has exposed critical security risks, particularly through jailbreak prompts that can bypass model alignment and induce harmful outputs. Despite intense research into both attack and defense techniques, the field remains fragmented: definitions, threat models, and evaluation criteria vary widely, impeding systematic progress and fair comparison. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we address these challenges by (1) proposing a holistic, multi-level taxonomy that organizes attacks, defenses, and vulnerabilities in LLM prompt security; (2) formalizing threat models and cost assumptions into machine-readable profiles for reproducible evaluation; (3) introducing an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized, auditable comparison of attacks and defenses; (4) releasing JAILBREAKDB, the largest annotated dataset of jailbreak and benign prompts to date;\footnote{The dataset is released at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/youbin2014/JailbreakDB}{\textcolor{purple}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/youbin2014/JailbreakDB}}.} and (5) presenting a comprehensive evaluation platform and leaderboard of state-of-the-art methods \footnote{will be released soon.}.

| **[FeatureFool: Zero-Query Fooling of Video Models via Feature Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18362v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover, no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy, video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.</p></details> |  |

However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our dataset is made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Leigest/MSR-Align.</p></details> |  |

Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 Figures, |

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.</p></details> |  |
