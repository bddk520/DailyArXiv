| **[Dark LLMs: The Growing Threat of Unaligned AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10066v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIG: Privacy Jailbreak Attack on LLMs via Gradient-based Iterative In-Context Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09921v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards.

| **[Adversarial Suffix Filtering: a Defense Pipeline for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09602v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in autonomous systems and public-facing environments, yet they remain susceptible to jailbreak vulnerabilities that may undermine their security and trustworthiness. Adversarial suffixes are considered to be the current state-of-the-art jailbreak, consistently outperforming simpler methods and frequently succeeding even in black-box settings. Existing defenses rely on access to the internal architecture of models limiting diverse deployment, increase memory and computation footprints dramatically, or can be bypassed with simple prompt engineering methods. We introduce $\textbf{Adversarial Suffix Filtering}$ (ASF), a lightweight novel model-agnostic defensive pipeline designed to protect LLMs against adversarial suffix attacks. ASF functions as an input preprocessor and sanitizer that detects and filters adversarially crafted suffixes in prompts, effectively neutralizing malicious injections. We demonstrate that ASF provides comprehensive defense capabilities across both black-box and white-box attack settings, reducing the attack efficacy of state-of-the-art adversarial suffix generation methods to below 4%, while only minimally affecting the target model's capabilities in non-adversarial scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Features in Prompts Jailbreak LLMs? Investigating the Mechanisms Behind Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03343v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaks have been a central focus of research regarding the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs), yet the mechanisms underlying these attacks remain poorly understood. While previous studies have predominantly relied on linear methods to detect jailbreak attempts and model refusals, we take a different approach by examining both linear and non-linear features in prompts that lead to successful jailbreaks. First, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,800 jailbreak attempts spanning 35 diverse attack methods. Leveraging this dataset, we train probes to classify successful from unsuccessful jailbreaks using the latent representations corresponding to prompt tokens. Notably, we find that even when probes achieve high accuracy in predicting the success of jailbreaks, their performance often fails to generalize to unseen attack methods. This reveals that different jailbreaking strategies exploit different non-linear, non-universal features. Next, we demonstrate that non-linear probes provide a powerful tool for steering model behavior. Specifically, we use these probes to guide targeted latent space perturbations, enabling us to effectively modulate the model's robustness against jailbreaks. Overall, our findings challenge the assumption that jailbreaks can be fully understood through linear or simple universal prompt features alone, highlighting the importance of a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms behind LLM vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Red Teaming the Mind of the Machine: A Systematic Evaluation of Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04806v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into consumer and enterprise applications. Despite their capabilities, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks that override alignment safeguards. This paper provides a systematic investigation of jailbreak strategies against various state-of-the-art LLMs. We categorize over 1,400 adversarial prompts, analyze their success against GPT-4, Claude 2, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna, and examine their generalizability and construction logic. We further propose layered mitigation strategies and recommend a hybrid red-teaming and sandboxing approach for robust LLM security.</p></details> | 7 Pages, 6 Figures |
| **[Concept-Level Explainability for Auditing & Steering LLM Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07610v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, Submission to Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[ThreatLens: LLM-guided Threat Modeling and Test Plan Generation for Hardware Security Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06821v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual threat modeling and test plan generation, which are labor-intensive, error-prone, and struggle to scale with increasing design complexity and evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we propose ThreatLens, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates security threat modeling and test plan generation for hardware security verification. ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant security knowledge, LLM-powered reasoning for threat assessment, and interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to security verification. We evaluated our framework on the NEORV32 SoC, demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been presented at IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fun-tuning: Characterizing the Vulnerability of Proprietary LLMs to Optimization-based Prompt Injection Attacks via the Fine-Tuning Interface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09798v2)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We surface a new threat to closed-weight Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables an attacker to compute optimization-based prompt injections. Specifically, we characterize how an attacker can leverage the loss-like information returned from the remote fine-tuning interface to guide the search for adversarial prompts. The fine-tuning interface is hosted by an LLM vendor and allows developers to fine-tune LLMs for their tasks, thus providing utility, but also exposes enough information for an attacker to compute adversarial prompts. Through an experimental analysis, we characterize the loss-like values returned by the Gemini fine-tuning API and demonstrate that they provide a useful signal for discrete optimization of adversarial prompts using a greedy search algorithm. Using the PurpleLlama prompt injection benchmark, we demonstrate attack success rates between 65% and 82% on Google's Gemini family of LLMs. These attacks exploit the classic utility-security tradeoff - the fine-tuning interface provides a useful feature for developers but also exposes the LLMs to powerful attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Data Contamination Detection Work (Well) for LLMs? A Survey and Evaluation on Detection Assumptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18966v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance across various benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However, as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern in their evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data and evaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. Multiple approaches have been developed to identify data contamination. These approaches rely on specific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings. To bridge this gap, we systematically review 50 papers on data contamination detection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they have been rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories of assumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our case studies focus on detecting direct, instance-level data contamination, which is also referred to as Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). Our analysis reveals that MIA approaches based on these three assumptions can have similar performance to random guessing, on datasets used in LLM pretraining, suggesting that current LLMs might learn data distributions rather than memorizing individual instances. Meanwhile, MIA can easily fail when there are data distribution shifts between the seen and unseen instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by NAACL 2025 findings.

| **[LATENT: LLM-Augmented Trojan Insertion and Evaluation Framework for Analog Netlist Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06364v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are integral to safety-critical applications. However, the globalization and outsourcing of A/MS ICs to untrusted third-party foundries expose them to security threats, particularly analog Trojans. Unlike digital Trojans which have been extensively studied, analog Trojans remain largely unexplored. There has been only limited research on their diversity and stealth in analog designs, where a Trojan is activated only during a narrow input voltage range. Effective defense techniques require a clear understanding of the attack vectors; however, the lack of diverse analog Trojan instances limits robust advances in detection strategies. To address this gap, we present LATENT, the first large language model (LLM)-driven framework for crafting stealthy, circuit-specific analog Trojans. LATENT incorporates LLM as an autonomous agent to intelligently insert and refine Trojan components within analog designs based on iterative feedback from a detection model. This feedback loop ensures that the inserted Trojans remain stealthy while successfully evading detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our generated Trojan designs exhibit an average Trojan-activation range of 15.74%, ensuring they remain inactive under most operating voltages, while causing a significant performance degradation of 11.3% upon activation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IEEE International Conference on LLM-Aided Design (ICLAD), 2025</p></details> |

In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 38 figures An earlier revision of this paper was accepted at ICML 2025.

| **[Large Language Models for Cyber Security: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04760v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities for leveraging artificial intelligence in various domains, including cybersecurity. As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats continue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of LLMs in cybersecurity (LLM4Security). By comprehensively collecting over 30K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 127 papers from top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic view of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the cybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings. First, we observe that LLMs are being applied to a wide range of cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, network intrusion detection, and phishing detection. Second, we find that the datasets used for training and evaluating LLMs in these tasks are often limited in size and diversity, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and representative datasets. Third, we identify several promising techniques for adapting LLMs to specific cybersecurity domains, such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain-specific pre-training. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities for future research in LLM4Security, including the need for more interpretable and explainable models, the importance of addressing data privacy and security concerns, and the potential for leveraging LLMs for proactive defense and threat hunting. Overall, our survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in LLM4Security and identifies several promising directions for future research.</p></details> | 56 pages,6 figures |
| **[Adversarial Attack on Large Language Models using Exponentiated Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09820v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always stays within the probability simplex.

| **[Self-Consuming Generative Models with Adversarially Curated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09768v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models have made it increasingly difficult to distinguish real data from model-generated synthetic data. Using synthetic data for successive training of future model generations creates "self-consuming loops", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore, synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on their preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is curated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop drives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those preferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or adversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit malicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this paper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining loops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the impact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions for the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we design attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a platform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's model from actual user preferences. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege. We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in January 22, 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

This paper reviews the application of Bayesian Networks (BNs) in cybersecurity risk modeling, highlighting their capacity to represent probabilistic dependencies, integrate diverse threat indicators, and support reasoning under uncertainty. A structured case study is presented in which a STRIDE-based attack tree for an automotive In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system is transformed into a Bayesian Network. Logical relationships are encoded using Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs), and threat likelihoods are derived from normalized DREAD scores. The model enables not only probabilistic inference of system compromise likelihood but also supports causal analysis using do-calculus and local sensitivity analysis to identify high-impact vulnerabilities. These analyses provide insight into the most influential nodes within the threat propagation chain, informing targeted mitigation strategies. While demonstrating the potential of BNs for dynamic and context-aware risk assessment, the study also outlines limitations related to scalability, reliance on expert input, static structure assumptions, and limited temporal modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for future enhancements through Dynamic Bayesian Networks, structure learning, and adaptive inference to better support real-time cybersecurity decision-making in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

However, MLaaS platforms must be safeguarded against security and privacy attacks, such as model extraction (MEA) attacks. The increasing integration of explainable AI (XAI) within MLaaS has introduced an additional privacy challenge, as attackers can exploit model explanations particularly counterfactual explanations (CFs) to facilitate MEA. In this paper, we investigate the trade offs among model performance, privacy, and explainability when employing Differential Privacy (DP), a promising technique for mitigating CF facilitated MEA. We evaluate two distinct DP strategies: implemented during the classification model training and at the explainer during CF generation.</p></details> |  |

One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Cyber Security: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04760v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities for leveraging artificial intelligence in various domains, including cybersecurity. As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats continue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of LLMs in cybersecurity (LLM4Security). By comprehensively collecting over 30K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 127 papers from top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic view of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the cybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings. First, we observe that LLMs are being applied to a wide range of cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, network intrusion detection, and phishing detection. Second, we find that the datasets used for training and evaluating LLMs in these tasks are often limited in size and diversity, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and representative datasets. Third, we identify several promising techniques for adapting LLMs to specific cybersecurity domains, such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain-specific pre-training. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities for future research in LLM4Security, including the need for more interpretable and explainable models, the importance of addressing data privacy and security concerns, and the potential for leveraging LLMs for proactive defense and threat hunting. Overall, our survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in LLM4Security and identifies several promising directions for future research.</p></details> | 56 pages,6 figures |

Although many models are aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques.
