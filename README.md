| **[Fuzz-Testing Meets LLM-Based Agents: An Automated and Efficient Framework for Jailbreaking Text-To-Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00523v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation by transforming textual descriptions into high-quality images. However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks. JailFuzzer is open-source and available at this repository: https://github.com/YingkaiD/JailFuzzer.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrivacyXray: Detecting Privacy Breaches in LLMs through Semantic Consistency and Probability Certainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19563v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions. PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Security in LLM Applications: A Performance Evaluation of Early Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19109v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal for average needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[ADVLLM: Iterative Self-Tuning LLMs for Enhanced Jailbreaking Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18469v4)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main (oral)</p></details> |
| **[Incivility and Rigidity: The Risks of Fine-Tuning LLMs for Political Argumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16813v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S. Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView. We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks, but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and deliberation support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04227v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Penetration-testing, while critical for validating defenses and uncovering vulnerabilities, is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. Our novel prototype, cochise, represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft AD testbed (GOAD). The evaluation deliberately utilizes GOAD to capture the intricate interactions and sometimes nondeterministic outcomes of live network pen-testing, moving beyond the limitations of synthetic benchmarks. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks, and generate scenario-specific attack parameters. Cochise also exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, automatically installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. Critically, we find that the associated costs are competitive with those incurred by professional pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15551v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings, 2025</p></details> |
| **[FDLLM: A Dedicated Detector for Black-Box LLMs Fingerprinting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiation-Based Extraction of Proprietary Data from Fine-Tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17353v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types, and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction, we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models, called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall, our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides insights for developing more secure models.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 2025 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'25), October 13-17, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan, China.

| **[DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which hinder their applicability to systems with dynamic memory states. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial RSs. To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.</p></details> |  |

| **[Bounding-box Watermarking: Defense against Model Extraction Attacks on Object Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13047v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed in a cloud often allow users to query models via the APIs. However, these APIs expose the models to model extraction attacks (MEAs). In this attack, the attacker attempts to duplicate the target model by abusing the responses from the API. Backdoor-based DNN watermarking is known as a promising defense against MEAs, wherein the defender injects a backdoor into extracted models via API responses. The backdoor is used as a watermark of the model; if a suspicious model has the watermark (i.e., backdoor), it is verified as an extracted model. This work focuses on object detection (OD) models.

| **[Towards Backdoor Stealthiness in Model Parameter Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05928v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on backdoor stealthiness focuses mainly on indistinguishable triggers in input space and inseparable backdoor representations in feature space, aiming to circumvent backdoor defenses that examine these respective spaces. However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a specific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of defense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are current backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse practical defenses? To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on input-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative defenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks designed to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by examining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying causes behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of backdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and feature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter space, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking comprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack called Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective module, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the parameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against state-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset of ImageNet. In addition, we show that ABI consistently improves the effectiveness of common backdoor attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at CCS 2025</p></details> |

However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks. JailFuzzer is open-source and available at this repository: https://github.com/YingkaiD/JailFuzzer.</p></details> |  |

Phishing attacks often lead to operational incidents and data breaches. As a result, many organizations allocate a substantial portion of their cybersecurity budgets to phishing awareness training, driven in part by compliance requirements. However, the effectiveness of this training remains in dispute. Empirical evidence of training (in)effectiveness is essential for evidence-based cybersecurity investment and policy development. Despite recent measurement studies, two critical gaps remain in the literature: (1) we lack a validated measure of phishing lure difficulty, and (2) there are few comparisons of different types of training in real-world business settings. To fill these gaps, we conducted a large-scale study ($N = 12{,}511$) of phishing effectiveness at a US-based financial technology (``fintech'') firm. Our two-factor design compared the effect of treatments (lecture-based, interactive, and control groups) on subjects' susceptibility to phishing lures of varying complexity (using the NIST Phish Scale). The NIST Phish Scale successfully predicted behavior (click rates: 7.0\% easy to 15.0\% hard emails, p $<$ 0.001), but training showed no significant main effects on clicks (p = 0.450) or reporting (p = 0.417). Effect sizes remained below 0.01, indicating little practical value in any of the phishing trainings we deployed. Our results add to the growing evidence that phishing training is ineffective, reinforcing the importance of phishing defense-in-depth and the merit of changes to processes and technology to reduce reliance on humans, as well as rebuking the training costs necessitated by regulatory requirements.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 apdx |

Despite rapid advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored, posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result, our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU vulnerabilities.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

However, the privacy risks associated with IARs remain unexplored, raising concerns regarding their responsible deployment. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive privacy analysis of IARs, comparing their privacy risks to the ones of DMs as reference points. Concretely, we develop a novel membership inference attack (MIA) that achieves a remarkably high success rate in detecting training images (with a True Positive Rate at False Positive Rate = 1% of 86.38% vs. 6.38% for DMs with comparable attacks). We leverage our novel MIA to provide dataset inference (DI) for IARs, and show that it requires as few as 6 samples to detect dataset membership (compared to 200 for DI in DMs), confirming a higher information leakage in IARs. Finally, we are able to extract hundreds of training data points from an IAR (e.g., 698 from VAR-d30). Our results suggest a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: while IARs excel in image generation quality and speed, they are empirically significantly more vulnerable to privacy attacks compared to DMs that achieve similar performance.

Even though model weights are hidden to protect the intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks, the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

While most existing approaches focus on identifying vulnerable packages or libraries, they often overlook the specific functions responsible for these vulnerabilities. Pinpointing vulnerable functions within packages or libraries is critical, as it can significantly reduce the risks associated with using open-source software. Identifying vulnerable patches is challenging because developers often submit code changes that are unrelated to vulnerability fixes. To address this issue, this paper introduces FuncVul, an innovative code chunk-based model for function-level vulnerability detection in C/C++ and Python, designed to identify multiple vulnerabilities within a function by focusing on smaller, critical code segments. To assess the model's effectiveness, we construct six code and generic code chunk based datasets using two approaches: (1) integrating patch information with large language models to label vulnerable samples and (2) leveraging large language models alone to detect vulnerabilities in function-level code. To design FuncVul vulnerability model, we utilise GraphCodeBERT fine tune model that captures both the syntactic and semantic aspects of code. Experimental results show that FuncVul outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving an average accuracy of 87-92% and an F1 score of 86-92% across all datasets. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that our code-chunk-based FuncVul model improves 53.9% accuracy and 42.0% F1-score than the full function-based vulnerability prediction.

Particularly, due to the remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA), revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments" are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed defense method.</p></details> |  |

Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary. Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset, DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.</p></details> |  |

However, these APIs expose the models to model extraction attacks (MEAs). In this attack, the attacker attempts to duplicate the target model by abusing the responses from the API. Backdoor-based DNN watermarking is known as a promising defense against MEAs, wherein the defender injects a backdoor into extracted models via API responses. The backdoor is used as a watermark of the model; if a suspicious model has the watermark (i.e., backdoor), it is verified as an extracted model. This work focuses on object detection (OD) models. Existing backdoor attacks on OD models are not applicable for model watermarking as the defense against MEAs on a realistic threat model. Our proposed approach involves inserting a backdoor into extracted models via APIs by stealthily modifying the bounding-boxes (BBs) of objects detected in queries while keeping the OD capability.
