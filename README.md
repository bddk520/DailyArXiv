| **[Tuning without Peeking: Provable Privacy and Generalization Bounds for LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01752v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, exposing gradients during training can leak sensitive information about the underlying data, raising privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide non-vacuous generalization bounds and strong theoretical guarantees for differential privacy, robustness to data poisoning attacks, and extraction attacks. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that black-box optimization methods-despite the scalability and computational challenges inherent to black-box approaches-are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance, generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets, and are robust to membership inference attacks. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization, offering suitability for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments while also providing non-vacuous generalization guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[P2P: A Poison-to-Poison Remedy for Reliable Backdoor Defense in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04503v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Model's Language Matters: A Comparative Privacy Analysis of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08813v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction, counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms in LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Internal Layers of LLMs Reveal Patterns for Jailbreak Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06594v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a pressing concern with the increasing prevalence and accessibility of conversational LLMs. Adversarial users often exploit these models through carefully engineered prompts to elicit restricted or sensitive outputs, a strategy widely referred to as jailbreaking. While numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed, attackers continuously develop novel prompting techniques, and no existing model can be considered fully resistant. In this study, we investigate the jailbreak phenomenon by examining the internal representations of LLMs, with a focus on how hidden layers respond to jailbreak versus benign prompts. Specifically, we analyze the open-source LLM GPT-J and the state-space model Mamba2, presenting preliminary findings that highlight distinct layer-wise behaviors. Our results suggest promising directions for further research on leveraging internal model dynamics for robust jailbreak detection and defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch your steps: Dormant Adversarial Behaviors that Activate upon LLM Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16567v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finetuning open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs) is standard practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now, finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which training on benign datasets leads to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that an adversary can create compromised LLMs that are performant and benign, yet exhibit adversarial behaviors once finetuned by downstream users. To this end, we propose an attack, FAB (Finetuning-activated Adversarial Behaviors), which compromises an LLM via meta-learning techniques that simulate downstream finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of adversarial behaviors in the finetuned models. At the same time, the compromised LLM is regularized to retain general capabilities and to exhibit no adversarial behaviors prior to finetuning. As a result, when users finetune (e.g., instruction-tuning, distillation, DPO) the seemingly benign model on their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its dormant adversarial behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three commonly considered target behaviors: unsolicited advertising, jailbreakability, and over-refusal. We show that FAB-triggers are robust to various finetuning choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler, post-training algorithm). Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions on the security of finetuning, revealing a critical attack vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defending MoE LLMs against Harmful Fine-Tuning via Safety Routing Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22745v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Multi-Trigger Poisoning Amplifies Backdoor Vulnerabilities in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11112v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger poisoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting LLM-as-a-Judge Policies via Verifiable Global Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08120v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms: 1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[(Token-Level) InfoRMIA: Stronger Membership Inference and Memorization Assessment for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05582v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved computational efficiency. In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage. We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on how adversarial inputs systematically affect the internal representation spaces of LLMs, a topic which remains poorly understood. We propose persistent homology (PH), a tool from topological data analysis, as a principled framework to characterize the multi-scale dynamics within LLM activations. Using PH, we systematically analyze six state-of-the-art models under two distinct adversarial conditions, indirect prompt injection and backdoor fine-tuning, and identify a consistent topological signature of adversarial influence. Across architectures and model sizes, adversarial inputs induce ``topological compression'', where the latent space becomes structurally simpler, collapsing from varied, compact, small-scale features into fewer, dominant, and more dispersed large-scale ones. This topological signature is statistically robust across layers, highly discriminative, and provides interpretable insights into how adversarial effects emerge and propagate. By quantifying the shape of activations and neuronal information flow, our architecture-agnostic framework reveals fundamental invariants of representational change, offering a complementary perspective to existing interpretability methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

While some researchers have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than 100%.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM 2025 |
| **[Pattern Enhanced Multi-Turn Jailbreaking: Exploiting Structural Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08859v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches (educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios). Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA</p></details> |  |

Overall, our findings provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms in LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |

While MCP enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP clients, attack scripts, and protection mechanisms to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across different hosts and models. In addition, current protection mechanisms have little effect against these attacks. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report from Lingnan University, Hong Kong.

However, the reliance on small, task-specific support datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification (\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | 19 pages |

This paper presents a comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while maintaining compliance in evolving domains.</p></details> |  |

Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2025</p></details> |

| **[Causal Additive Models with Unobserved Causal Paths and Backdoor Paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07646v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal additive models provide a tractable yet expressive framework for causal discovery in the presence of hidden variables. However, when unobserved backdoor or causal paths exist between two variables, their causal relationship is often unidentifiable under existing theories. We establish sufficient conditions under which causal directions can be identified in many such cases. In particular, we derive conditions that enable identification of the parent-child relationship in a bow, an adjacent pair of observed variables sharing a hidden common parent. This represents a notoriously difficult case in causal discovery, and, to our knowledge, no prior work has established such identifiability in any causal model without imposing assumptions on the hidden variables. Our conditions rely on new characterizations of regression sets and a hybrid approach that combines independence among regression residuals with conditional independencies among observed variables. We further provide a sound and complete algorithm that incorporates these insights, and empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegTrans: Transferable Adversarial Examples for Segmentation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08922v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than 100%.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM 2025 |
| **[Pattern Enhanced Multi-Turn Jailbreaking: Exploiting Structural Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08859v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches (educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios). Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA</p></details> |  |

Mostly evaluated for English, this paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction, counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms in LLM deployments.</p></details> |  |
