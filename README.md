| **[Foot-In-The-Door: A Multi-turn Jailbreak for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19820v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring AI safety is crucial as large language models become increasingly integrated into real-world applications. A key challenge is jailbreak, where adversarial prompts bypass built-in safeguards to elicit harmful disallowed outputs. Inspired by psychological foot-in-the-door principles, we introduce FITD,a novel multi-turn jailbreak method that leverages the phenomenon where minor initial commitments lower resistance to more significant or more unethical transgressions.Our approach progressively escalates the malicious intent of user queries through intermediate bridge prompts and aligns the model's response by itself to induce toxic responses. Extensive experimental results on two jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that FITD achieves an average attack success rate of 94% across seven widely used models, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of LLM self-corruption, highlighting vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies and emphasizing the risks inherent in multi-turn interactions.The code is available at https://github.com/Jinxiaolong1129/Foot-in-the-door-Jailbreak .</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Demystifying RCE Vulnerabilities in LLM-Integrated Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02926v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs show promise in transforming software development, with a growing interest in integrating them into more intelligent apps. Frameworks like LangChain aid LLM-integrated app development, offering code execution utility/APIs for custom actions. However, these capabilities theoretically introduce Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, enabling remote code execution through prompt injections. No prior research systematically investigates these frameworks' RCE vulnerabilities or their impact on applications and exploitation consequences. Therefore, there is a huge research gap in this field. In this study, we propose LLMSmith to detect, validate and exploit the RCE vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated frameworks and apps. To achieve this goal, we develop two novel techniques, including 1) a lightweight static analysis to examine LLM integration mechanisms, and construct call chains to identify RCE vulnerabilities in frameworks; 2) a systematical prompt-based exploitation method to verify and exploit the found vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated apps. This technique involves various strategies to control LLM outputs, trigger RCE vulnerabilities and launch subsequent attacks. Our research has uncovered a total of 20 vulnerabilities in 11 LLM-integrated frameworks, comprising 19 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. Of these, 17 have been confirmed by the framework developers, with 11 vulnerabilities being assigned CVE IDs. For the 51 apps potentially affected by RCE, we successfully executed attacks on 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL injection. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities and construct practical attacks to demonstrate the hazards in reality. Last, we propose several mitigation measures for both framework and app developers to counteract such attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Great, Now Write an Article About That: The Crescendo Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01833v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as jailbreaks, seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a simple multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b and LlaMA-3 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we present Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack and demonstrate its efficacy against state-of-the-art models through our evaluations. Crescendomation surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on the AdvBench subset dataset, achieving 29-61% higher performance on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro. Finally, we also demonstrate Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Surface-Level Patterns: An Essence-Driven Defense Framework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19041v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful requests, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying "attack essence" remains the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Investigating Generalization of One-shot LLM Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18862v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing steering vectors through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these vectors generalize. We consider several steering optimization techniques, including multiple novel ones, and find that the resulting vectors effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot steering vectors that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized steering vectors can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, to quantitatively assess steering effectiveness in instruction-tuned models, we develop a novel evaluation framework using sequence probabilities from the corresponding base model. With this framework, we analyze how steering vectors modulate an instruction-tuned LLM's ability to recover from outputting false information, and find that this ability derives from the base model. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing steering vectors on a single example can mediate misaligned behavior in LLMs, and provide a path toward better understanding the relationship between LLM behavior and activation space structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Efficient Safety Retrofitting Against Jailbreaking for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13603v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient alignment technique that steers LLMs towards preferable outputs by training on preference data, bypassing the need for explicit reward models. Its simplicity enables easy adaptation to various domains and safety requirements. This paper examines DPO's effectiveness in model safety against jailbreaking attacks while minimizing data requirements and training costs. We introduce Egida, a dataset expanded from multiple sources, which includes 27 different safety topics and 18 different attack styles, complemented with synthetic and human labels. This data is used to boost the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B/72B-Instruct) across topics and attack styles. In addition to safety evaluations, we assess their post-alignment performance degradation in general purpose tasks, and their tendency to over refusal. Following the proposed methodology, trained models reduce their Attack Success Rate by 10%-30%, using small training efforts (2,000 samples) with low computational cost (3\$ for 8B models, 20\$ for 72B models). Safety aligned models generalize to unseen topics and attack styles, with the most successful attack style reaching a success rate around 5%. Size and family are found to strongly influence model malleability towards safety, pointing at the importance of pre-training choices. To validate our findings, a large independent assessment of human preference agreement with Llama-Guard-3-8B is conducted by the authors and the associated dataset Egida-HSafe is released. Overall, this study illustrates how affordable and accessible it is to enhance LLM safety using DPO while outlining its current limitations. All datasets and models are released to enable reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Evaluations and Comparisons for LLM Unlearning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09179v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The imperative to eliminate undesirable data memorization underscores the significance of machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs). Recent research has introduced a series of promising unlearning methods, notably boosting the practical significance of the field. Nevertheless, adopting a proper evaluation framework to reflect the true unlearning efficacy is also essential yet has not received adequate attention. This paper seeks to refine the evaluation of LLM unlearning by addressing two key challenges -- a) the robustness of evaluation metrics and b) the trade-offs between competing goals. The first challenge stems from findings that current metrics are susceptible to various red teaming scenarios. It indicates that they may not reflect the true extent of knowledge retained by LLMs but rather tend to mirror superficial model behaviors, thus prone to attacks. We address this issue by devising and assessing a series of candidate metrics, selecting the most robust ones under various types of attacks. The second challenge arises from the conflicting goals of eliminating unwanted knowledge while retaining those of others. This trade-off between unlearning and retention often fails to conform the Pareto frontier, rendering it subtle to compare the efficacy between methods that excel only in either unlearning or retention. We handle this issue by proposing a calibration method that can restore the original performance on non-targeted data after unlearning, thereby allowing us to focus exclusively on assessing the strength of unlearning. Our evaluation framework notably enhances the effectiveness when assessing and comparing various LLM unlearning methods, further allowing us to benchmark existing works, identify their proper hyper-parameters, and explore new tricks to enhance their practical efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and implementation of a distributed security threat detection system integrating federated learning and multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17763v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional security protection methods struggle to address sophisticated attack vectors in large-scale distributed systems, particularly when balancing detection accuracy with data privacy concerns. This paper presents a novel distributed security threat detection system that integrates federated learning with multimodal large language models (LLMs). Our system leverages federated learning to ensure data privacy while employing multimodal LLMs to process heterogeneous data sources including network traffic, system logs, images, and sensor data. Experimental evaluation on a 10TB distributed dataset demonstrates that our approach achieves 96.4% detection accuracy, outperforming traditional baseline models by 4.1 percentage points. The system reduces both false positive and false negative rates by 1.8 and 2.4 percentage points respectively. Performance analysis shows that our system maintains efficient processing capabilities in distributed environments, requiring 180 seconds for model training and 3.8 seconds for threat detection across the distributed network. These results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and computational efficiency while preserving data privacy, suggesting strong potential for real-world deployment in large-scale security systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAPILLON: Efficient and Stealthy Fuzz Testing-Powered Jailbreaks for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866v4)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[RapidPen: Fully Automated IP-to-Shell Penetration Testing with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16730v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RapidPen, a fully automated penetration testing (pentesting) framework that addresses the challenge of achieving an initial foothold (IP-to-Shell) without human intervention. Unlike prior approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted exploits in a fully automated manner. In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a 60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities, while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges. Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing model merging techniques primarily focus on resolving conflicts between task-specific models, they often overlook potential security threats, particularly the risk of backdoor attacks in the open-source model ecosystem. In this paper, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of existing model merging methods to backdoor attacks, identifying two critical challenges: backdoor succession and backdoor transfer. To address these issues, we propose a novel Defense-Aware Merging (DAM) approach that simultaneously mitigates task interference and backdoor vulnerabilities. Specifically, DAM employs a meta-learning-based optimization method with dual masks to identify a shared and safety-aware subspace for model merging. These masks are alternately optimized: the Task-Shared mask identifies common beneficial parameters across tasks, aiming to preserve task-specific knowledge while reducing interference, while the Backdoor-Detection mask isolates potentially harmful parameters to neutralize security threats. This dual-mask design allows us to carefully balance the preservation of useful knowledge and the removal of potential vulnerabilities. Compared to existing merging methods, DAM achieves a more favorable balance between performance and security, reducing the attack success rate by 2-10 percentage points while sacrificing only about 1% in accuracy. Furthermore, DAM exhibits robust performance and broad applicability across various types of backdoor attacks and the number of compromised models involved in the merging process. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/Yangjinluan/DAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>arxiv...</summary><p>arxiv version of ICLR2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Natural Language Perplexity: Detecting Dead Code Poisoning in Code Generation Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20246v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for code-related tasks has raised concerns about the security of their training datasets. One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior. Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions. Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code. DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision. Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing. Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Tip of Efficiency: Uncovering the Submerged Threats of Jailbreak Attacks in Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19883v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs) have become increasingly prominent in the deployment on edge devices due to their high efficiency and low computational cost. While researchers continue to advance the capabilities of SLMs through innovative training strategies and model compression techniques, the security risks of SLMs have received considerably less attention compared to large language models (LLMs).To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the security performance of 13 state-of-the-art SLMs under various jailbreak attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most SLMs are quite susceptible to existing jailbreak attacks, while some of them are even vulnerable to direct harmful prompts.To address the safety concerns, we evaluate several representative defense methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the security of SLMs. We further analyze the potential security degradation caused by different SLM techniques including architecture compression, quantization, knowledge distillation, and so on. We expect that our research can highlight the security challenges of SLMs and provide valuable insights to future work in developing more robust and secure SLMs.</p></details> | 12 pages. 6 figures |

However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source R1 models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on R1 is needed. (2) The distilled reasoning model shows poorer safety performance compared to its safety-aligned base models. (3) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions. (4) The thinking process in R1 models pose greater safety concerns than their final answers. Our study provides insights into the security implications of reasoning models and highlights the need for further advancements in R1 models' safety to close the gap.</p></details> |  |

Membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a sample is included in a model's training dataset, can serve as a foundation for broader privacy threats. Existing defenses designed for traditional classification models do not account for the sequential nature of text data. As a result, they either require significant computational resources or fail to effectively mitigate privacy risks in LLMs. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective empirical privacy defense for protecting training data of language modeling by leveraging the token-specific characteristics. By analyzing token dynamics during training, we propose a token selection strategy that categorizes tokens into hard tokens for learning and memorized tokens for unlearning. Subsequently, our training-phase defense optimizes a novel dual-purpose token-level loss to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between utility and privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only provides strong protection against MIAs but also improves language modeling performance by around 10\% across various LLM architectures and datasets compared to the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stealthy Backdoor Attack in Self-Supervised Learning Vision Encoders for Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18290v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) vision encoders learn high-quality image representations and thus have become a vital part of developing vision modality of large vision language models (LVLMs). Due to the high cost of training such encoders, pre-trained encoders are widely shared and deployed into many LVLMs, which are security-critical or bear societal significance. Under this practical scenario, we reveal a new backdoor threat that significant visual hallucinations can be induced into these LVLMs by merely compromising vision encoders. Because of the sharing and reuse of these encoders, many downstream LVLMs may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders, leading to widespread backdoors. In this work, we propose BadVision, the first method to exploit this vulnerability in SSL vision encoders for LVLMs with novel trigger optimization and backdoor learning techniques. We evaluate BadVision on two types of SSL encoders and LVLMs across eight benchmarks. We show that BadVision effectively drives the LVLMs to attacker-chosen hallucination with over 99% attack success rate, causing a 77.6% relative visual understanding error while maintaining the stealthiness. SoTA backdoor detection methods cannot detect our attack effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAP-DIFF: Semantic Adversarial Patch Generation for Black-Box Face Recognition Models via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19710v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the need to evaluate the robustness of face recognition (FR) models, many efforts have focused on adversarial patch attacks that mislead FR models by introducing localized perturbations. Impersonation attacks are a significant threat because adversarial perturbations allow attackers to disguise themselves as legitimate users. This can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, system damage, and misuse of resources. However, research on such attacks in FR remains limited. Existing adversarial patch generation methods exhibit limited efficacy in impersonation attacks due to (1) the need for high attacker capabilities, (2) low attack success rates, and (3) excessive query requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method SAP-DIFF that leverages diffusion models to generate adversarial patches via semantic perturbations in the latent space rather than direct pixel manipulation. We introduce an attention disruption mechanism to generate features unrelated to the original face, facilitating the creation of adversarial samples and a directional loss function to guide perturbations toward the target identity feature space, thereby enhancing attack effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on popular FR models and datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average attack success rate improvement of 45.66% (all exceeding 40%), and a reduction in the number of queries by about 40% compared to the SOTA approach</p></details> |  |

This is mainly attributed to the over-reliance on model-specific features and regions, particularly in the image modality. In this paper, we propose an elegant yet highly effective method termed Meticulous Adversarial Attack (MAA) to fully exploit model-independent characteristics and vulnerabilities of individual samples, achieving enhanced generalizability and reduced model dependence. MAA emphasizes fine-grained optimization of adversarial images by developing a novel resizing and sliding crop (RScrop) technique, incorporating a multi-granularity similarity disruption (MGSD) strategy. Extensive experiments across diverse VLP models, multiple benchmark datasets, and a variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MAA significantly enhances the effectiveness and transferability of adversarial attacks. A large cohort of performance studies is conducted to generate insights into the effectiveness of various model configurations, guiding future advancements in this domain.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment (DynVLA) Attack, a novel approach that injects dynamic perturbations into the vision-language connector to enhance generalization across diverse vision-language alignment of different models. Our experimental results show that DynVLA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across various MLLMs, including BLIP2, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT4, LLaVA, and closed-source models such as Gemini.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09766</p></details> |

While this new approach offers a promising route for balancing model utility and safety, its robustness remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Malicious-Educator, a benchmark that disguises extremely dangerous or malicious requests beneath seemingly legitimate educational prompts. Our experiments reveal severe security flaws in popular commercial-grade LRMs, including OpenAI o1/o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. For instance, although OpenAI's o1 model initially maintains a high refusal rate of about 98%, subsequent model updates significantly compromise its safety; and attackers can easily extract criminal strategies from DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking without any additional tricks. To further highlight these vulnerabilities, we propose Hijacking Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT), a universal and transferable attack method that leverages the model's own displayed intermediate reasoning to jailbreak its safety reasoning mechanism. Under H-CoT, refusal rates sharply decline-dropping from 98% to below 2%-and, in some instances, even transform initially cautious tones into ones that are willing to provide harmful content. We hope these findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety mechanisms to preserve the benefits of advanced reasoning capabilities without compromising ethical standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://maliciouseducator.org/</p></details> |
