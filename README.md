| **[VIGIL: Defending LLM Agents Against Tool Stream Injection via Verify-Before-Commit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05755v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM agents operating in open environments face escalating risks from indirect prompt injection, particularly within the tool stream where manipulated metadata and runtime feedback hijack execution flow. Existing defenses encounter a critical dilemma as advanced models prioritize injected rules due to strict alignment while static protection mechanisms sever the feedback loop required for adaptive reasoning. To reconcile this conflict, we propose \textbf{VIGIL}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from restrictive isolation to a verify-before-commit protocol. By facilitating speculative hypothesis generation and enforcing safety through intent-grounded verification, \textbf{VIGIL} preserves reasoning flexibility while ensuring robust control. We further introduce \textbf{SIREN}, a benchmark comprising 959 tool stream injection cases designed to simulate pervasive threats characterized by dynamic dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{VIGIL} outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic defenses by reducing the attack success rate by over 22\% while more than doubling the utility under attack compared to static baselines, thereby achieving an optimal balance between security and utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[MindGuard: Intrinsic Decision Inspection for Securing LLM Agents Against Metadata Poisoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20412v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is increasingly adopted to standardize the interaction between LLM agents and external tools. However, this trend introduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is poisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing defenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally ineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no behavioral trace to monitor. Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents, providing provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and poisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision remains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation between LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we choose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize this as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning process as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts and edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust DDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently detect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\%-99\% average precision in detecting poisoned invocations, 95\%-100\% attribution accuracy, with processing times under one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as an adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a solid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision level.</p></details> |  |
| **[Burn-After-Use for Preventing Data Leakage through a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture in Enterprise LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06627v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture (SMTA) combined with a novel concept Burn-After-Use (BAU) mechanism for enterprise LLM environments to effectively prevent data leakage. As institutions increasingly adopt LLMs across departments, the risks of data leakage have become a critical security and compliance concern. The proposed SMTA isolates LLM instances across departments and enforces rigorous context ownership boundaries within an internally deployed infrastructure. The BAU mechanism introduces data confidentiality by enforcing ephemeral conversational contexts that are automatically destroyed after use, preventing cross-session or cross-user inference. The evaluation to SMTA and BAU is through two sets of realistic and reproducible experiments comprising of 127 test iterations. One aspect of this experiment is to assess prompt-based and semantic leakage attacks in a multi-tenant architecture (Appendix A) across 55 infrastructure-level attack tests, including vector-database credential compromise and shared logging pipeline exposure. SMTA achieves 92% defense success rate, demonstrating strong semantic isolation while highlighting residual risks from credential misconfiguration and observability pipelines. Another aspect is to evaluate the robustness of BAU under realistic failure scenarios (Appendix B) using four empirical metrics: Local Residual Persistence Rate (LRPR), Remote Residual Persistence Rate (RRPR), Image Frame Exposure Rate (IFER), and Burn Timer Persistence Rate (BTPR). Across 72 test iterations, BAU achieves a 76.75% success rate in mitigating post-session leakage threats across the client, server, application, infrastructure, and cache layers. These results show that SMTA and BAU together enforce strict isolation, complete session ephemerality, strong confidentiality guarantees, non-persistence, and policy-aligned behavior for enterprise LLMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SpatialJB: How Text Distribution Art Becomes the "Jailbreak Key" for LLM Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09321v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have powerful capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which is a critical barrier to their safe web real-time application. Current commercial LLM providers deploy output guardrails to filter harmful outputs, yet these defenses are not impenetrable. Due to LLMs' reliance on autoregressive, token-by-token inference, their semantic representations lack robustness to spatially structured perturbations, such as redistributing tokens across different rows, columns, or diagonals. Exploiting the Transformer's spatial weakness, we propose SpatialJB to disrupt the model's output generation process, allowing harmful content to bypass guardrails without detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on leading LLMs get nearly 100% ASR, demonstrating the high effectiveness of SpatialJB. Even after adding advanced output guardrails, like the OpenAI Moderation API, SpatialJB consistently maintains a success rate exceeding 75%, outperforming current jailbreak techniques by a significant margin. The proposal of SpatialJB exposes a key weakness in current guardrails and emphasizes the importance of spatial semantics, offering new insights to advance LLM safety research. To prevent potential misuse, we also present baseline defense strategies against SpatialJB and evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating such attacks. The code for the attack, baseline defenses, and a demo are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpatialJailbreak-8E63.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Editing LLMs Inject Harm?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20224v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new information channel. Meanwhile, one critical but under-explored question is: Is it possible to bypass the safety alignment and inject harmful information into LLMs stealthily? In this paper, we propose to reformulate knowledge editing as a new type of safety threat for LLMs, namely Editing Attack, and conduct a systematic investigation with a newly constructed dataset EditAttack. Specifically, we focus on two typical safety risks of Editing Attack including Misinformation Injection and Bias Injection. For the first risk, we find that editing attacks can inject both commonsense and long-tail misinformation into LLMs, and the effectiveness for the former one is particularly high. For the second risk, we discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can degrade the overall fairness. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks. Our discoveries demonstrate the emerging misuse risks of knowledge editing techniques on compromising the safety alignment of LLMs and the feasibility of disseminating misinformation or bias with LLMs as new channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Proceedings of AAAI 2026.

| **[KryptoPilot: An Open-World Knowledge-Augmented LLM Agent for Automated Cryptographic Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09129v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions play a central role in modern cybersecurity as a platform for training practitioners and evaluating offensive and defensive techniques derived from real-world vulnerabilities. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), existing LLM-based agents remain ineffective on high-difficulty cryptographic CTF challenges, which require precise cryptanalytic knowledge, stable long-horizon reasoning, and disciplined interaction with specialized toolchains. Through a systematic exploratory study, we show that insufficient knowledge granularity, rather than model reasoning capacity, is a primary factor limiting successful cryptographic exploitation: coarse or abstracted external knowledge often fails to support correct attack modeling and implementation. Motivated by this observation, we propose KryptoPilot, an open-world knowledge-augmented LLM agent for automated cryptographic exploitation. KryptoPilot integrates dynamic open-world knowledge acquisition via a Deep Research pipeline, a persistent workspace for structured knowledge reuse, and a governance subsystem that stabilizes reasoning through behavioral constraints and cost-aware model routing. This design enables precise knowledge alignment while maintaining efficient reasoning across heterogeneous subtasks. We evaluate KryptoPilot on two established CTF benchmarks and in six real-world CTF competitions. KryptoPilot achieves a complete solve rate on InterCode-CTF, solves between 56 and 60 percent of cryptographic challenges on the NYU-CTF benchmark, and successfully solves 26 out of 33 cryptographic challenges in live competitions, including multiple earliest-solved and uniquely-solved instances. These results demonstrate the necessity of open-world, fine-grained knowledge augmentation and governed reasoning for scaling LLM-based agents to real-world cryptographic exploitation.</p></details> | 14 Pages,4 figures |
| **[STELP: Secure Transpilation and Execution of LLM-Generated Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05467v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14381v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) systems increasingly power everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on manually well-crafted prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to query poisoning alone: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to ΔASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability. We also propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake reward ΔASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 19th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2026)</p></details> |
| **[STAR: Detecting Inference-time Backdoors in LLM Reasoning via State-Transition Amplification Ratio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08511v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent LLMs increasingly integrate reasoning mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this explicit reasoning exposes a new attack surface for inference-time backdoors, which inject malicious reasoning paths without altering model parameters. Because these attacks generate linguistically coherent paths, they effectively evade conventional detection. To address this, we propose STAR (State-Transition Amplification Ratio), a framework that detects backdoors by analyzing output probability shifts. STAR exploits the statistical discrepancy where a malicious input-induced path exhibits high posterior probability despite a low prior probability in the model's general knowledge. We quantify this state-transition amplification and employ the CUSUM algorithm to detect persistent anomalies. Experiments across diverse models (8B-70B) and five benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR exhibits robust generalization capabilities, consistently achieving near-perfect performance (AUROC $\approx$ 1.0) with approximately $42\times$ greater efficiency than existing baselines. Furthermore, the framework proves robust against adaptive attacks attempting to bypass detection.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

This paper extends research on VirCo, a Virtual Client for Online Counseling, designed to complement traditional role-playing methods in academic training by simulating realistic client interactions. Building on previous work, we introduce a new dataset incorporating adversarial attacks to test the ability of large language models (LLMs) to maintain their assigned roles (role-consistency). The study focuses on evaluating the role consistency and coherence of the Vicuna model's responses, comparing these findings with earlier research. Additionally, we assess and compare various open-source LLMs for their performance in sustaining role consistency during virtual client interactions. Our contributions include creating an adversarial dataset, evaluating conversation coherence and persona consistency, and providing a comparative analysis of different LLMs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Exploring the Secondary Risks of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12382v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[STaR: Sensitive Trajectory Regulation for Unlearning in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09281v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced automated multi-step reasoning, but their ability to generate complex Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories introduces severe privacy risks, as sensitive information may be deeply embedded throughout the reasoning process. Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulated Ensemble Attack: Transferring Jailbreaks Across Fine-tuned Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01741v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread practice of fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) raises a critical security concern: jailbreak vulnerabilities in base models may persist in downstream variants, enabling transferable attacks across fine-tuned systems. To investigate this risk, we propose the Simulated Ensemble Attack (SEA), a grey-box jailbreak framework that assumes full access to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target. SEA enhances transferability via Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS), which models bounded parameter variations in the vision encoder, and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG), which stabilizes adversarial optimization through auxiliary textual guidance. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family demonstrate that SEA achieves consistently high transfer success and toxicity rates across diverse fine-tuned variants, including safety-enhanced models, while standard PGD-based image jailbreaks exhibit negligible transferability. Further analysis reveals that fine-tuning primarily induces localized parameter shifts around the base model, explaining why attacks optimized over a simulated neighborhood transfer effectively. We also show that SEA generalizes across different base generations (e.g., Qwen2.5/3-VL), indicating that its effectiveness arises from shared fine-tuning-induced behaviors rather than architecture- or initialization-specific factors.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces WAMM, an AI-driven multiclass web attack detection framework designed to reveal the limitations of rule-based systems by reclassifying HTTP requests into OWASP-aligned categories for a specific technology stack. WAMM applies a multi-phase enhancement pipeline to the SR-BH 2020 dataset that includes large-scale deduplication, LLM-guided relabeling, realistic attack data augmentation, and LLM-based filtering, producing three refined datasets. Four machine and deep learning models are evaluated using a unified feature space built from statistical and text-based representations. Results show that using an augmented and LLM-filtered dataset on the same technology stack, XGBoost reaches 99.59% accuracy with microsecond-level inference while deep learning models degrade under noisy augmentation. When tested against OWASP CRS using an unseen augmented dataset, WAMM achieves true positive block rates between 96 and 100% with improvements of up to 86%. These findings expose gaps in widely deployed rule-based defenses and demonstrate that curated training pipelines combined with efficient machine learning models enable a more resilient, real-time approach to web attack detection suitable for production WAF environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TROJail: Trajectory-Level Optimization for Multi-Turn Large Language Model Jailbreaks with Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07761v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have seen widespread adoption, yet they remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment. This has led to the task of training automated multi-turn attackers to probe model safety vulnerabilities. However, existing approaches typically rely on turn-level optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate this task as a multi-turn reinforcement learning problem, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn response as the outcome reward. To address the sparse supervision of the outcome reward, we introduce TROJail, which employs two process rewards to evaluate the utility of intermediate prompts and integrate them into advantage estimation. These rewards (1) penalize overly harmful prompts that trigger the model's refusal mechanism, and (2) encourage steering the semantic relevance of responses toward the targeted harmful content. Experimental results show improved attack success rates across multiple models and benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/xxiqiao/TROJail. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful content.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |

Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

In this paper, we introduce AI-CAPTCHA, a unified framework that offers (i) an evaluation framework, ACEval, which includes advanced LALM- and ASR-based solvers, and (ii) a novel audio CAPTCHA approach, IllusionAudio, leveraging audio illusions. Through extensive evaluations of seven widely deployed audio CAPTCHAs, we show that most existing methods can be solved with high success rates by advanced LALMs and ASR models, exposing critical security weaknesses. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a new audio CAPTCHA approach, IllusionAudio, which exploits perceptual illusion cues rooted in human auditory mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method defeats all tested LALM- and ASR-based attacks while achieving a 100% human pass rate, significantly outperforming existing audio CAPTCHA methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike jailbreaks or prompt injection, Overflow arises under ordinary interaction settings and can lead to elevated serving cost, latency, and cross-user performance degradation, particularly when scaled across many requests. Beyond usability, the stakes are economic and environmental: unnecessary tokens increase per-request cost and energy consumption, compounding into substantial operational spend and carbon footprint at scale. Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention. Using a standardized protocol with a fixed budget of 5000 new tokens, we evaluate nine open- and closed-source models and observe pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions. Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) quantify tail risk; within-prompt variance and cross-model correlations show that Overflow is broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors. A lightweight mitigation-a fixed conciseness reminder-attenuates right tails and lowers CSR for all strategies across the majority of models. Our findings position length control as a measurable reliability, cost, and sustainability concern rather than a stylistic quirk. By enabling standardized comparison of length-control robustness across models, BenchOverflow provides a practical basis for selecting deployments that minimize resource waste and operating expense, and for evaluating defenses that curb compute amplification without eroding task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.</p></details> |  |

KT models estimate students' concept mastery from interaction data, but their performance is sensitive to input data quality. Gaming behaviors, such as excessive hint use, may misrepresent students' knowledge and undermine model reliability. However, systematic investigations of how different types of gaming behaviors affect KT remain scarce, and existing studies rely on costly manual analysis that does not capture behavioral diversity. In this study, we conceptualize gaming behaviors as a form of data poisoning, defined as the deliberate submission of incorrect or misleading interaction data to corrupt a model's learning process. We design Data Poisoning Attacks (DPAs) to simulate diverse gaming patterns and systematically evaluate their impact on KT model performance. Moreover, drawing on advances in DPA detection, we explore unsupervised approaches to enhance the generalizability of gaming behavior detection. We find that KT models' performance tends to decrease especially in response to random guess behaviors. Our findings provide insights into the vulnerabilities of KT models and highlight the potential of adversarial methods for improving the robustness of learning analytics systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full research paper accepted at Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK '26) conference, see https://doi.org/10.1145/3785022.3785036</p></details> |

While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning.
