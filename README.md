| **[LLM-driven Provenance Forensics for Threat Investigation and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21323v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PROVSEEK, an LLM-powered agentic framework for automated provenance-driven forensic analysis and threat intelligence extraction. PROVSEEK employs specialized toolchains to dynamically retrieve relevant context by generating precise, context-aware queries that fuse knowledge from threat reports with evidence from system provenance data. The framework resolves provenance queries, orchestrates multiple role-specific agents, and synthesizes structured, ground-truth verifiable forensic summaries. By combining agent orchestration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, data-guided filtration using a behavioral model, PROVSEEK enables adaptive multi-step analysis that iteratively refines hypotheses, verifies supporting evidence, and produces scalable, interpretable forensic explanations of attack behaviors. PROVSEEK is designed for automated threat investigation without task-specific training data, enabling forensic-style investigation even when no prior knowledge of the environment. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on publicly available DARPA datasets, demonstrating that PROVSEEK outperforms retrieval-based methods for the intelligence extraction task, achieving a 34% improvement in contextual precision/recall; and for threat detection task, PROVSEEK achieves 22%/29% higher precision/recall compared to both a baseline agent approach and State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Provenance-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS). In our scalability study, we show that PROVSEEK increases token usage by 1.42x and latency by 1.63x as the database size increases 50x, making it optimal for large-scale deployment. We also conducted an ablation and error analysis study to show how different components of PROVSEEK affect the detection performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-based Quantitative Framework for Evaluating High-Stealthy Backdoor Risks in OSS Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13341v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern software development workflows, the open-source software supply chain contributes significantly to efficient and convenient engineering practices. With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice. However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 fig...</summary><p>7 figures, 4 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[NeuroStrike: Neuron-Level Attacks on Aligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11864v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment is critical for the ethical deployment of large language models (LLMs), guiding them to avoid generating harmful or unethical content. Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability. This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreaking LLMs via Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01223v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs' alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs' alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs. Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available at https://github.com/nercode/Work. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CONTENT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Synergistic Cognitive Biases to Bypass Safety in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22564v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompressionAttack: Exploiting Prompt Compression as a New Attack Surface in LLM-Powered Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22963v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered agents often use prompt compression to reduce inference costs, but this introduces a new security risk. Compression modules, which are optimized for efficiency rather than safety, can be manipulated by adversarial inputs, causing semantic drift and altering LLM behavior. This work identifies prompt compression as a novel attack surface and presents CompressionAttack, the first framework to exploit it. CompressionAttack includes two strategies: HardCom, which uses discrete adversarial edits for hard compression, and SoftCom, which performs latent-space perturbations for soft compression. Experiments on multiple LLMs show up to an average ASR of 83% and 87% in two tasks, while remaining highly stealthy and transferable. Case studies in three practical scenarios confirm real-world impact, and current defenses prove ineffective, highlighting the need for stronger protections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiated Directional Intervention A Framework for Evading LLM Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06852v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment instills in Large Language Models (LLMs) a critical capacity to refuse malicious requests. Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.</p></details> | AAAI-26-AIA |
| **[LLM Reinforcement in Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12782v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Model alignment research mostly focuses on improving model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on examples and prompting. Research has shown that LLM jailbreak probability increases with the size of the user input or conversation length. There is a lack of appropriate research into means of strengthening alignment which also scale with user input length. We propose interruptions as a possible solution to this problem. Interruptions are control sentences added to the user input approximately every x tokens for some arbitrary x. We suggest that this can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Evolve the Method, Not the Prompts: Evolutionary Synthesis of Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12710v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated red teaming frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, yet they share a fundamental limitation: their jailbreak logic is confined to selecting, combining, or refining pre-existing attack strategies. This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods. We release our framework to facilitate future research in this new direction of evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods.

| **[LLMs Cannot Reliably Judge (Yet?): A Comprehensive Assessment on the Robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09443v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks, driving the development and widespread adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge systems for automated evaluation, including red teaming and benchmarking. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that can manipulate evaluation outcomes, raising critical concerns about their robustness and trustworthiness. Existing evaluation methods for LLM-based judges are often fragmented and lack a unified framework for comprehensive robustness assessment. Furthermore, the impact of prompt template design and model selection on judge robustness has rarely been explored, and their performance in real-world deployments remains largely unverified. To address these gaps, we introduce RobustJudge, a fully automated and scalable framework designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge systems. Specifically, RobustJudge investigates the effectiveness of 15 attack methods and 7 defense strategies across 12 models (RQ1), examines the impact of prompt template design and model selection (RQ2), and evaluates the security of real-world deployments (RQ3). Our study yields three key findings: (1) LLM-as-a-Judge systems are highly vulnerable to attacks such as PAIR and combined attacks, while defense mechanisms such as re-tokenization and LLM-based detectors can provide enhanced protection; (2) robustness varies substantially across prompt templates (up to 40%); (3) deploying RobustJudge on Alibaba's PAI platform uncovers previously undiscovered vulnerabilities. These results offer practical insights for building trustworthy LLM-as-a-Judge systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[ForgeDAN: An Evolutionary Framework for Jailbreaking Aligned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13548v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has brought both transformative applications and new security risks, including jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards to elicit harmful outputs. Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[VEIL: Jailbreaking Text-to-Video Models via Visual Exploitation from Implicit Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13127v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their simplicity, these methods, which lack target specificity, limit players' ability to give complex tactical instructions and hinder immersive gameplay experiences. To address this problem, we propose the FPS AI Companion who Understands Language (F.A.C.U.L.), the first real-time AI system that enables players to communicate and collaborate with AI companions using natural language. By integrating natural language processing with a confidence-based framework, F.A.C.U.L. efficiently decomposes complex commands and interprets player intent. It also employs a dynamic entity retrieval method for environmental awareness, aligning human intentions with decision-making. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our method supports real-time language interactions, enabling players to issue complex commands such as ``clear the second floor'', ``take cover behind that tree'', or ``retreat to the river''. The system provides real-time behavioral responses and vocal feedback, ensuring seamless tactical collaboration. Using the popular FPS game \textit{Arena Breakout: Infinite} as a case study, we present comparisons demonstrating the efficacy of our approach and discuss the advantages and limitations of AI companions based on real-world user feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures,</p></details> |

However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source reasoning models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on open LRMs is needed. (2) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions. (3) Safety thinking emerges in the reasoning process of LRMs, but fails frequently against adversarial attacks. (4) The thinking process in R1 models poses greater safety concerns than their final answers. Our study provides insights into the security implications of reasoning models and highlights the need for further advancements in R1 models' safety to close the gap.</p></details> |  |

On the contrary, humans have an uncanny ability to generalize to unknown visual stimuli. The efficient coding hypothesis posits that early visual structures (retina, Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, and primary visual cortex) transform inputs to reduce redundancy and maximize information efficiency. This mechanism of redundancy minimization in early vision was the inspiration for CNN regularization techniques that force convolutional kernels to be orthogonal.

In this paper, we introduce a flexible and lightweight approach that regularizes a subset of first-layer convolutional filters by making them pairwise-orthogonal, which reduces the redundancy of the extracted features but at the same time prevents putting excessive constraints on the network.

However, adversarial attacks, an unnoticed alteration, can deceive models, leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, a generative adversarial attack method is proposed that uses the CLIP model to create highly effective and visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations. The CLIP model's ability to align text and image representation helps incorporate natural language semantics with a guided loss to generate effective adversarial examples that look identical to the original inputs. This integration allows extensive scene manipulation, creating perturbations in multi-object environments specifically designed to deceive multilabel classifiers. Our approach integrates the concentrated perturbation strategy from Saliency-based Auto-Encoder (SSAE) with the dissimilar text embeddings similar to Generative Adversarial Multi-Object Scene Attacks (GAMA), resulting in perturbations that both deceive classification models and maintain high structural similarity to the original images. The model was tested on various tasks across diverse black-box victim models. The experimental results show that our method performs competitively, achieving comparable or superior results to existing techniques, while preserving greater visual fidelity.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Existing security schemes are unable to provide sub-10 ms (milliseconds) anomaly detection and distributed coordination of large-scale networks of vehicles within an acceptable safety/privacy framework. This paper introduces a three-tier hybrid security architecture HAVEN (Hierarchical Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Network), which decouples real-time local threat detection and distributed coordination operations. It incorporates a light ensemble anomaly detection model on the edge (first layer), Byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning to aggregate threat intelligence at a regional scale (middle layer), and selected blockchain mechanisms (top layer) to ensure critical security coordination. Extensive experimentation is done on a real-world autonomous driving dataset. Large-scale simulations with the number of vehicles ranging between 100 and 1000 and different attack types, such as sensor spoofing, jamming, and adversarial model poisoning, are conducted to test the scalability and resiliency of HAVEN. Experimental findings show sub-10 ms detection latency with an accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 92% across multimodal sensor data, Byzantine fault tolerance validated with 20\% compromised nodes, and a reduced blockchain storage overhead, guaranteeing sufficient differential privacy. The proposed framework overcomes the important trade-off between real-time safety obligation and distributed security coordination with novel three-tiered processing. The scalable architecture of HAVEN is shown to provide great improvement in detection accuracy as well as network resilience over other methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal</p></details> |

We show that this interaction hides a critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws: (1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3) encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

However, these gradients pose significant privacy risks, as sensitive training data is embedded within them. Existing gradient inversion attacks suffer from significantly degraded reconstruction performance when gradients are perturbed by noise-a common defense mechanism. In this paper, we introduce gradient-guided conditional diffusion models for reconstructing private images from leaked gradients, without prior knowledge of the target data distribution. Our approach leverages the inherent denoising capability of diffusion models to circumvent the partial protection offered by noise perturbation, thereby improving attack performance under such defenses. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the reconstruction error bounds and the convergence properties of the attack loss, characterizing the impact of key factors-such as noise magnitude and attacked model architecture-on reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate our attack's superior reconstruction performance with Gaussian noise-perturbed gradients, and confirm our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoMark: A Distortion-Free Robust Watermarking Framework for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16359v3)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces \textbf{VideoMark}, a distortion-free robust watermarking framework for video diffusion models. As diffusion models excel in generating realistic videos, reliable content attribution is increasingly critical. However, existing video watermarking methods often introduce distortion by altering the initial distribution of diffusion variables and are vulnerable to temporal attacks, such as frame deletion, due to variable video lengths. VideoMark addresses these challenges by employing a \textbf{pure pseudorandom initialization} to embed watermarks, avoiding distortion while ensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space to preserve generation quality. To enhance robustness, we adopt a frame-wise watermarking strategy with pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes, using a fixed watermark sequence with randomly selected starting indices for each video. For watermark extraction, we propose a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that leverages edit distance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence, ensuring resilience against temporal attacks. Experimental results show that VideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while maintaining video quality comparable to watermark-free generation. The watermark remains imperceptible to attackers without the secret key, offering superior invisibility compared to other frameworks. VideoMark provides a practical, training-free solution for content attribution in diffusion-based video generation.

| **[ForgeDAN: An Evolutionary Framework for Jailbreaking Aligned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13548v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has brought both transformative applications and new security risks, including jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards to elicit harmful outputs. Existing automated jailbreak generation approaches e.g. AutoDAN, suffer from limited mutation diversity, shallow fitness evaluation, and fragile keyword-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[VEIL: Jailbreaking Text-to-Video Models via Visual Exploitation from Implicit Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13127v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their simplicity, these methods, which lack target specificity, limit players' ability to give complex tactical instructions and hinder immersive gameplay experiences. To address this problem, we propose the FPS AI Companion who Understands Language (F.A.C.U.L.), the first real-time AI system that enables players to communicate and collaborate with AI companions using natural language. By integrating natural language processing with a confidence-based framework, F.A.C.U.L. efficiently decomposes complex commands and interprets player intent. It also employs a dynamic entity retrieval method for environmental awareness, aligning human intentions with decision-making. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our method supports real-time language interactions, enabling players to issue complex commands such as ``clear the second floor'', ``take cover behind that tree'', or ``retreat to the river''. The system provides real-time behavioral responses and vocal feedback, ensuring seamless tactical collaboration. Using the popular FPS game \textit{Arena Breakout: Infinite} as a case study, we present comparisons demonstrating the efficacy of our approach and discuss the advantages and limitations of AI companions based on real-world user feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures,</p></details> |
