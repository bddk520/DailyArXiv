However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables.

| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities or adversarial prompting techniques, this study examines a more direct threat scenario: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted either directly or indirectly. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and directness across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives prompts from real vulnerable code samples to assess vulnerability reproduction accuracy. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, and Gemma) using ESBMC static analysis to assess both the presence of vulnerabilities and the correctness of the generated vulnerability type. Results show all models frequently produce vulnerable outputs, with Qwen2 achieving highest correctness rates. User persona significantly affects success, where student personas achieved higher vulnerability rates than professional roles, while direct prompts were marginally more effective. Vulnerability reproduction followed an inverted-U pattern with cyclomatic complexity, peaking at moderate ranges. Our findings expose limitations of safety mechanisms in open-source models, particularly for seemingly benign educational requests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[IPAD: Inverse Prompt for AI Detection -- A Robust and Explainable LLM-Generated Text Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15902v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinction between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide interpretable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and two Distinguishers that examine the probability that the input texts align with the predicted prompts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IPAD outperforms the strongest baselines by 9.05% (Average Recall) on in-distribution data, 12.93% (AUROC) on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and 5.48% (AUROC) on attacked data. IPAD also performs robustly on structured datasets. Furthermore, an interpretability assessment is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[A comprehensive study of LLM-based argument classification: from LLAMA through GPT-4o to Deepseek-R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dark Side of LLMs Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emoji Attack: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks Against Judge LLM Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01077v4)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.</p></details> |  |

Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions of Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid LLM-Enhanced Intrusion Detection for Zero-Day Threats in IoT Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07413v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity defences suited for modern connected environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, IEEE conference</p></details> |

While existing defenses primarily concentrate on model-centric approaches, the impact of data on MI robustness remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore Random Erasing (RE), a technique traditionally used for improving model generalization under occlusion, and uncover its surprising effectiveness as a defense against MI attacks. Specifically, our novel feature space analysis shows that models trained with RE-images introduce a significant discrepancy between the features of MI-reconstructed images and those of the private data. At the same time, features of private images remain distinct from other classes and well-separated from different classification regions. These effects collectively degrade MI reconstruction quality and attack accuracy while maintaining reasonable natural accuracy. Furthermore, we explore two critical properties of RE including Partial Erasure and Random Location. Partial Erasure prevents the model from observing entire objects during training. We find this has a significant impact on MI, which aims to reconstruct the entire objects. Random Location of erasure plays a crucial role in achieving a strong privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings highlight RE as a simple yet effective defense mechanism that can be easily integrated with existing privacy-preserving techniques. Extensive experiments across 37 setups demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the privacy-utility trade-off. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our defense over existing methods across different MI attacks, network architectures, and attack configurations. For the first time, we achieve a significant degradation in attack accuracy without a decrease in utility for some configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR).

| **[The Man Behind the Sound: Demystifying Audio Private Attribute Profiling via Multimodal Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10016v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes from audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling. This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

However, these models might be backdoored, and malicious users can submit trigger-embedded inputs to manipulate the model predictions. Current graph backdoor defenses have several limitations: 1) depending on model-related details, 2) requiring additional model fine-tuning, and 3) relying upon extra explainability tools, all of which are infeasible under stringent privacy policies. To address those limitations, we propose GraphProt, which allows resource-constrained business owners to rely on third parties to avoid backdoor attacks on GNN-based graph classifiers. Our GraphProt is model-agnostic and only relies on the input graph. The key insight is to leverage subgraph information for prediction, thereby mitigating backdoor effects induced by triggers. GraphProt comprises two components: clustering-based trigger elimination and robust subgraph ensemble. Specifically, we first propose feature-topology clustering that aims to remove most of the anomalous subgraphs (triggers). Moreover, we design subgraph sampling strategies based on feature-topology clustering to build a robust classifier via majority vote. Experimental results across three backdoor attacks and six benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphProt significantly reduces the backdoor attack success rate while preserving the model accuracy on regular graph classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have to add a rigorous mathematical proof to the thesis proposal, and the process of the current proposal is not rigorous enough</p></details> |

These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Motivated by these advancements, this paper explores the feasibility of LLMs in modifying malware source code to generate variants. We introduce LLMalMorph, a semi-automated framework that leverages semantical and syntactical code comprehension by LLMs to generate new malware variants. LLMalMorph extracts function-level information from the malware source code and employs custom-engineered prompts coupled with strategically defined code transformations to guide the LLM in generating variants without resource-intensive fine-tuning. To evaluate LLMalMorph, we collected 10 diverse Windows malware samples of varying types, complexity and functionality and generated 618 variants. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the detection rates of antivirus engines of these malware variants to some extent while preserving malware functionalities. In addition, despite not optimizing against any Machine Learning (ML)-based malware detectors, several variants also achieved notable attack success rates against an ML-based malware classifier. We also discuss the limitations of current LLM capabilities in generating malware variants from source code and assess where this emerging technology stands in the broader context of malware variant generation.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In this paper, we shed light on how model leaderboards -- ranked platforms for model discovery and evaluation -- can serve as a powerful channel for adversaries for stealthy large-scale distribution of poisoned models. We present TrojanClimb, a general framework that enables injection of malicious behaviors while maintaining competitive leaderboard performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four diverse modalities: text-embedding, text-generation, text-to-speech and text-to-image, showing that adversaries can successfully achieve high leaderboard rankings while embedding arbitrary harmful functionalities, from backdoors to bias injection. Our findings reveal a significant vulnerability in the machine learning ecosystem, highlighting the urgent need to redesign leaderboard evaluation mechanisms to detect and filter malicious (e.g., poisoned) models, while exposing broader security implications for the machine learning community regarding the risks of adopting models from unverified sources.</p></details> |  |

These models have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread adoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious concerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process or expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation of privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack strategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of Interests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire image, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental results across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and BLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while maintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity scores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work contributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a practical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available at: https://github.com/hbrachemi/Vlm_defense-attack.</p></details> |  |

AI-based detection methods can help mitigate these risks; however, the performance of such models is inherently dependent on the quality and diversity of their training data. Presently, the available datasets are heavily skewed towards English and Chinese audio, which limits the global applicability of these anti-spoofing systems. To address this limitation, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset (MLAAD), version 7, created using 101 TTS models, comprising 52 different architectures, to generate 485.3 hours of synthetic voice in 40 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD and observe that it demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild and Fake-Or-Real when used as a training resource. Moreover, compared to the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, each excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD and making a trained model accessible via an interactive webserver, we aim to democratize anti-spoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of specialists, and contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and deepfakes.</p></details> | IJCNN 2024 |

However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

Despite a growing body of research on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface, capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships, prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation, persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference).

While existing defenses primarily concentrate on model-centric approaches, the impact of data on MI robustness remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore Random Erasing (RE), a technique traditionally used for improving model generalization under occlusion, and uncover its surprising effectiveness as a defense against MI attacks. Specifically, our novel feature space analysis shows that models trained with RE-images introduce a significant discrepancy between the features of MI-reconstructed images and those of the private data. At the same time, features of private images remain distinct from other classes and well-separated from different classification regions. These effects collectively degrade MI reconstruction quality and attack accuracy while maintaining reasonable natural accuracy. Furthermore, we explore two critical properties of RE including Partial Erasure and Random Location. Partial Erasure prevents the model from observing entire objects during training. We find this has a significant impact on MI, which aims to reconstruct the entire objects. Random Location of erasure plays a crucial role in achieving a strong privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings highlight RE as a simple yet effective defense mechanism that can be easily integrated with existing privacy-preserving techniques. Extensive experiments across 37 setups demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the privacy-utility trade-off. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our defense over existing methods across different MI attacks, network architectures, and attack configurations. For the first time, we achieve a significant degradation in attack accuracy without a decrease in utility for some configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR).

This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
