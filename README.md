| **[Red-Teaming LLM Multi-Agent Systems via Communication Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14847v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have revolutionized complex problem-solving capability by enabling sophisticated agent collaboration through message-based communications. While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamental Limitations in Defending LLM Finetuning APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14828v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM developers have imposed technical interventions to prevent fine-tuning misuse attacks, attacks where adversaries evade safeguards by fine-tuning the model using a public API. Previous work has established several successful attacks against specific fine-tuning API defences. In this work, we show that defences of fine-tuning APIs that seek to detect individual harmful training or inference samples ('pointwise' detection) are fundamentally limited in their ability to prevent fine-tuning attacks. We construct 'pointwise-undetectable' attacks that repurpose entropy in benign model outputs (e.g. semantic or syntactic variations) to covertly transmit dangerous knowledge. Our attacks are composed solely of unsuspicious benign samples that can be collected from the model before fine-tuning, meaning training and inference samples are all individually benign and low-perplexity. We test our attacks against the OpenAI fine-tuning API, finding they succeed in eliciting answers to harmful multiple-choice questions, and that they evade an enhanced monitoring system we design that successfully detects other fine-tuning attacks. We encourage the community to develop defences that tackle the fundamental limitations we uncover in pointwise fine-tuning API defences.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEARL: Towards Permutation-Resilient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14628v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The in-context learning (ICL) capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform challenging tasks using provided demonstrations. However, ICL is highly sensitive to the ordering of demonstrations, leading to instability in predictions. This paper shows that this vulnerability can be exploited to design a natural attack - difficult for model providers to detect - that achieves nearly 80% success rate on LLaMA-3 by simply permuting the demonstrations. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on post-processing and fail to enhance the model's inherent robustness to input permutations, raising concerns about safety and reliability of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose Permutation-resilient learning (PEARL), a novel framework based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which optimizes model performance against the worst-case input permutation. Specifically, PEARL consists of a permutation-proposal network (P-Net) and the LLM. The P-Net generates the most challenging permutations by treating it as an optimal transport problem, which is solved using an entropy-constrained Sinkhorn algorithm. Through minimax optimization, the P-Net and the LLM iteratively optimize against each other, progressively improving the LLM's robustness. Experiments on synthetic pre-training and real-world instruction tuning tasks demonstrate that PEARL effectively mitigates permutation attacks and enhances performance. Notably, despite being trained on fewer shots and shorter contexts, PEARL achieves performance gains of up to 40% when scaled to many-shot and long-context scenarios, highlighting its efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[BaxBench: Can LLMs Generate Correct and Secure Backends?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11844v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in computer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Secure Program Partitioning for Smart Contracts with LLM's In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14215v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are highly susceptible to manipulation attacks due to the leakage of sensitive information. Addressing manipulation vulnerabilities is particularly challenging because they stem from inherent data confidentiality issues rather than straightforward implementation bugs. To tackle this by preventing sensitive information leakage, we present PartitionGPT, the first LLM-driven approach that combines static analysis with the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to partition smart contracts into privileged and normal codebases, guided by a few annotated sensitive data variables. We evaluated PartitionGPT on 18 annotated smart contracts containing 99 sensitive functions. The results demonstrate that PartitionGPT successfully generates compilable, and verified partitions for 78% of the sensitive functions while reducing approximately 30% code compared to function-level partitioning approach. Furthermore, we evaluated PartitionGPT on nine real-world manipulation attacks that lead to a total loss of 25 million dollars, PartitionGPT effectively prevents eight cases, highlighting its potential for broad applicability and the necessity for secure program partitioning during smart contract development to diminish manipulation vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Faceted Studies on Data Poisoning can Advance LLM Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14182v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lifecycle of large language models (LLMs) is far more complex than that of traditional machine learning models, involving multiple training stages, diverse data sources, and varied inference methods. While prior research on data poisoning attacks has primarily focused on the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs, these attacks face significant challenges in practice. Secure data collection, rigorous data cleaning, and the multistage nature of LLM training make it difficult to inject poisoned data or reliably influence LLM behavior as intended. Given these challenges, this position paper proposes rethinking the role of data poisoning and argue that multi-faceted studies on data poisoning can advance LLM development. From a threat perspective, practical strategies for data poisoning attacks can help evaluate and address real safety risks to LLMs. From a trustworthiness perspective, data poisoning can be leveraged to build more robust LLMs by uncovering and mitigating hidden biases, harmful outputs, and hallucinations. Moreover, from a mechanism perspective, data poisoning can provide valuable insights into LLMs, particularly the interplay between data and model behavior, driving a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Layers in Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17003v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when subjected to fine-tuning attacks. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as ``safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Safety Retrofitting Against Jailbreaking for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13603v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an efficient alignment technique that steers LLMs towards preferable outputs by training on preference data, bypassing the need for explicit reward models. Its simplicity enables easy adaptation to various domains and safety requirements. This paper examines DPO's effectiveness in model safety against jailbreaking attacks while minimizing data requirements and training costs. We introduce Egida, a dataset expanded from multiple sources, which includes 27 different safety topics and 18 different attack styles, complemented with synthetic and human labels. This data is used to boost the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-7B/72B-Instruct) across topics and attack styles. In addition to safety evaluations, we assess their post-alignment performance degradation in general purpose tasks, and their tendency to over refusal. Following the proposed methodology, trained models reduce their Attack Success Rate by 10%-30%, using small training efforts (2,000 samples) with low computational cost (3\$ for 8B models, 20\$ for 72B models). Safety aligned models generalize to unseen topics and attack styles, with the most successful attack style reaching a success rate around 5%. Size and family are found to strongly influence model malleability towards safety, pointing at the importance of pre-training choices. To validate our findings, a large independent assessment of human preference agreement with Llama-Guard-3-8B is conducted by the authors and the associated dataset Egida-HSafe is released. Overall, this study illustrates how affordable and accessible it is to enhance LLM safety using DPO while outlining its current limitations. All datasets and models are released to enable reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[RevPRAG: Revealing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation through LLM Activation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18948v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches the input to LLMs by retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.</p></details> |  |

| **[Safety Evaluation of DeepSeek Models in Chinese Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11137v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the DeepSeek series of models, leveraging their exceptional reasoning capabilities and open-source strategy, is reshaping the global AI landscape. Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmark and periodically update this report to provide more comprehensive and accurate assessment outcomes. Please refer to the latest version of the paper for the most recent evaluation results and conclusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[HiddenDetect: Detecting Jailbreak Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models via Monitoring Hidden States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14744v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of additional modalities increases the susceptibility of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to safety risks, such as jailbreak attacks, compared to their language-only counterparts. While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/leigest519/HiddenDetect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moshi Moshi? A Model Selection Hijacking Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14586v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model selection is a fundamental task in Machine Learning~(ML), focusing on selecting the most suitable model from a pool of candidates by evaluating their performance on specific metrics. This process ensures optimal performance, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse tasks and environments. Despite its critical role, its security from the perspective of adversarial ML remains unexplored. This risk is heightened in the Machine-Learning-as-a-Service model, where users delegate the training phase and the model selection process to third-party providers, supplying data and training strategies. Therefore, attacks on model selection could harm both the user and the provider, undermining model performance and driving up operational costs. In this work, we present MOSHI (MOdel Selection HIjacking adversarial attack), the first adversarial attack specifically targeting model selection. Our novel approach manipulates model selection data to favor the adversary, even without prior knowledge of the system. Utilizing a framework based on Variational Auto Encoders, we provide evidence that an attacker can induce inefficiencies in ML deployment. We test our attack on diverse computer vision and speech recognition benchmark tasks and different settings, obtaining an average attack success rate of 75.42%. In particular, our attack causes an average 88.30% decrease in generalization capabilities, an 83.33% increase in latency, and an increase of up to 105.85% in energy consumption. These results highlight the significant vulnerabilities in model selection processes and their potential impact on real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUIA: Model Inversion Attack against Federated Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14558v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the introduction of regulations related to the ``right to be forgotten", federated learning (FL) is facing new privacy compliance challenges. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU research has primarily focused on improving the efficiency of unlearning, with less attention paid to the potential privacy vulnerabilities inherent in these methods. To address this gap, we draw inspiration from gradient inversion attacks in FL and propose the federated unlearning inversion attack (FUIA). The FUIA is specifically designed for the three types of FU (sample unlearning, client unlearning, and class unlearning), aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of the privacy leakage risks associated with FU. In FUIA, the server acts as an honest-but-curious attacker, recording and exploiting the model differences before and after unlearning to expose the features and labels of forgotten data. FUIA significantly leaks the privacy of forgotten data and can target all types of FU. This attack contradicts the goal of FU to eliminate specific data influence, instead exploiting its vulnerabilities to recover forgotten data and expose its privacy flaws. Extensive experimental results show that FUIA can effectively reveal the private information of forgotten data. To mitigate this privacy leakage, we also explore two potential defense methods, although these come at the cost of reduced unlearning effectiveness and the usability of the unlearned model.</p></details> | Initial manuscript |

While these systems are designed with safety mechanisms, such as rejecting harmful instructions through alignment, their security remains largely unexplored. This gap leaves LLM-MASs vulnerable to targeted disruptions. In this paper, we introduce Contagious Recursive Blocking Attacks (Corba), a novel and simple yet highly effective attack that disrupts interactions between agents within an LLM-MAS. Corba leverages two key properties: its contagious nature allows it to propagate across arbitrary network topologies, while its recursive property enables sustained depletion of computational resources. Notably, these blocking attacks often involve seemingly benign instructions, making them particularly challenging to mitigate using conventional alignment methods. We evaluate Corba on two widely-used LLM-MASs, namely, AutoGen and Camel across various topologies and commercial models. Additionally, we conduct more extensive experiments in open-ended interactive LLM-MASs, demonstrating the effectiveness of Corba in complex topology structures and open-source models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/Corba.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing methods either depend on gradient estimation or require white-box access to model parameters, which limits their applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose PPO-MI, a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for black-box model inversion attacks. Our approach formulates the inversion task as a Markov Decision Process, where an agent navigates the latent space of a generative model to reconstruct private training samples using only model predictions. By employing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a momentum-based state transition mechanism, along with a reward function balancing prediction accuracy and exploration, PPO-MI ensures efficient latent space exploration and high query efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments illustrates that PPO-MI outperforms the existing methods while require less attack knowledge, and it is robust across various model architectures and datasets. These results underline its effectiveness and generalizability in practical black-box scenarios, raising important considerations for the privacy vulnerabilities of deployed machine learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, submitting to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Making Them a Malicious Database: Exploiting Query Code to Jailbreak Aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09723v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of natural language processing. Unfortunately, LLMs face significant security and ethical risks. Although techniques such as safety alignment are developed for defense, prior researches reveal the possibility of bypassing such defenses through well-designed jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose QueryAttack, a novel framework to examine the generalizability of safety alignment. By treating LLMs as knowledge databases, we translate malicious queries in natural language into structured non-natural query language to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs, and the results show that QueryAttack not only can achieve high attack success rates (ASRs), but also can jailbreak various defense methods. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against QueryAttack, which can reduce ASR by up to 64% on GPT-4-1106.

| **[Eliminating Backdoors in Neural Code Models for Secure Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04683v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural code models (NCMs) have been widely used to address various code understanding tasks, such as defect detection. However, numerous recent studies reveal that such models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoored NCMs function normally on normal/clean code snippets, but exhibit adversary-expected behavior on poisoned code snippets injected with the adversary-crafted trigger. It poses a significant security threat. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective techniques to detect and eliminate backdoors stealthily implanted in NCMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we innovatively propose a backdoor elimination technique for secure code understanding, called EliBadCode. EliBadCode eliminates backdoors in NCMs by inverting/reverse-engineering and unlearning backdoor triggers. Specifically, EliBadCode first filters the model vocabulary for trigger tokens based on the naming conventions of specific programming languages to reduce the trigger search space and cost. Then, EliBadCode introduces a sample-specific trigger position identification method, which can reduce the interference of non-backdoor (adversarial) perturbations for subsequent trigger inversion, thereby producing effective inverted backdoor triggers efficiently. Backdoor triggers can be viewed as backdoor (adversarial) perturbations. Subsequently, EliBadCode employs a Greedy Coordinate Gradient algorithm to optimize the inverted trigger and designs a trigger anchoring method to purify the inverted trigger. Finally, EliBadCode eliminates backdoors through model unlearning. We evaluate the effectiveness of EliBadCode in eliminating backdoors implanted in multiple NCMs used for three safety-critical code understanding tasks. The results demonstrate that EliBadCode can effectively eliminate backdoors while having minimal adverse effects on the normal functionality of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 33rd ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2025)</p></details> |

This work investigates a critical security vulnerability: attackers can steal prompt templates using only a limited number of sample images. To investigate this threat, we introduce Prism, a prompt-stealing benchmark consisting of 50 templates and 450 images, organized into Easy and Hard difficulty levels. To identify the vulnerabity of VLMs to prompt stealing, we propose EvoStealer, a novel template stealing method that operates without model fine-tuning by leveraging differential evolution algorithms. The system first initializes population sets using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on predefined patterns, then iteratively generates enhanced offspring through MLLMs. During evolution, EvoStealer identifies common features across offspring to derive generalized templates. Our comprehensive evaluation conducted across open-source (INTERNVL2-26B) and closed-source models (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) demonstrates that EvoStealer's stolen templates can reproduce images highly similar to originals and effectively generalize to other subjects, significantly outperforming baseline methods with an average improvement of over 10%. Moreover, our cost analysis reveals that EvoStealer achieves template stealing with negligible computational expenses. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/whitepagewu/evostealer.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,8 figures,4 tables</p></details> |

| **[Safety Evaluation of DeepSeek Models in Chinese Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11137v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the DeepSeek series of models, leveraging their exceptional reasoning capabilities and open-source strategy, is reshaping the global AI landscape. Despite these advantages, they exhibit significant safety deficiencies. Research conducted by Robust Intelligence, a subsidiary of Cisco, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that DeepSeek-R1 has a 100\% attack success rate when processing harmful prompts. Additionally, multiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical safety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust performance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial safety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has predominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a gap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese contexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a Chinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically evaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts, revealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results quantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing key insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmark and periodically update this report to provide more comprehensive and accurate assessment outcomes. Please refer to the latest version of the paper for the most recent evaluation results and conclusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/leigest519/HiddenDetect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moshi Moshi? A Model Selection Hijacking Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14586v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model selection is a fundamental task in Machine Learning~(ML), focusing on selecting the most suitable model from a pool of candidates by evaluating their performance on specific metrics. This process ensures optimal performance, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse tasks and environments. Despite its critical role, its security from the perspective of adversarial ML remains unexplored. This risk is heightened in the Machine-Learning-as-a-Service model, where users delegate the training phase and the model selection process to third-party providers, supplying data and training strategies. Therefore, attacks on model selection could harm both the user and the provider, undermining model performance and driving up operational costs. In this work, we present MOSHI (MOdel Selection HIjacking adversarial attack), the first adversarial attack specifically targeting model selection. Our novel approach manipulates model selection data to favor the adversary, even without prior knowledge of the system. Utilizing a framework based on Variational Auto Encoders, we provide evidence that an attacker can induce inefficiencies in ML deployment. We test our attack on diverse computer vision and speech recognition benchmark tasks and different settings, obtaining an average attack success rate of 75.42%. In particular, our attack causes an average 88.30% decrease in generalization capabilities, an 83.33% increase in latency, and an increase of up to 105.85% in energy consumption. These results highlight the significant vulnerabilities in model selection processes and their potential impact on real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
