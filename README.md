| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[A comprehensive study of LLM-based argument classification: from LLAMA through GPT-4o to Deepseek-R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15606v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.</p></details> |  |

Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., "DevOps Engineer") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLMs Copy to Think: Uncovering Copy-Guided Attacks in Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16773v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to automated code analysis, enabling tasks such as vulnerability detection and code comprehension. However, their integration introduces novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we identify and investigate a new class of prompt-based attacks, termed Copy-Guided Attacks (CGA), which exploit the inherent copying tendencies of reasoning-capable LLMs. By injecting carefully crafted triggers into external code snippets, adversaries can induce the model to replicate malicious content during inference. This behavior enables two classes of vulnerabilities: inference length manipulation, where the model generates abnormally short or excessively long reasoning traces; and inference result manipulation, where the model produces misleading or incorrect conclusions. We formalize CGA as an optimization problem and propose a gradient-based approach to synthesize effective triggers. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs shows that CGA reliably induces infinite loops, premature termination, false refusals, and semantic distortions in code analysis tasks. While highly effective in targeted settings, we observe challenges in generalizing CGA across diverse prompts due to computational constraints, posing an open question for future research. Our findings expose a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in LLM-powered development pipelines and call for urgent advances in prompt-level defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth Gives a False Sense of Privacy: LLM Internal States Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16372v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines, yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025.

| **[ShadowCode: Towards (Automatic) External Prompt Injection Attack against Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v6)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have led to the widespread adoption of code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) for programming tasks. Despite their success in deployment, their security research is left far behind. This paper introduces a new attack paradigm: (automatic) external prompt injection against Code LLMs, where attackers generate concise, non-functional induced perturbations and inject them within a victim's code context. These induced perturbations can be disseminated through commonly used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base), manipulating Code LLMs to achieve malicious objectives during the code completion process. Compared to existing attacks, this method is more realistic and threatening: it does not necessitate control over the model's training process, unlike backdoor attacks, and can achieve specific malicious objectives that are challenging for adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we propose ShadowCode, a simple yet effective method that automatically generates induced perturbations based on code simulation to achieve effective and stealthy external prompt injection. ShadowCode designs its perturbation optimization objectives by simulating realistic code contexts and employs a greedy optimization approach with two enhancement modules: forward reasoning enhancement and keyword-based perturbation design. We evaluate our method across 13 distinct malicious objectives, generating 31 threat cases spanning three popular programming languages. Our results demonstrate that ShadowCode successfully attacks three representative open-source Code LLMs (achieving up to a 97.9% attack success rate) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with over 90% attack success rate) across all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional induced perturbation.

| **[OMNISEC: LLM-Driven Provenance-based Intrusion Detection via Retrieval-Augmented Behavior Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03108v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have been widely used for endpoint threat analysis. These studies can be broadly categorized into rule-based detection systems and learning-based detection systems. Among these, due to the evolution of attack techniques, rules cannot dynamically model all the characteristics of attackers. As a result, such systems often face false negatives. Learning-based detection systems are further divided into supervised learning and anomaly detection. The scarcity of attack samples hinders the usability and effectiveness of supervised learning-based detection systems in practical applications. Anomaly-based detection systems face a massive false positive problem because they cannot distinguish between changes in normal behavior and real attack behavior. The alert results of detection systems are closely related to the manual labor costs of subsequent security analysts. To reduce manual analysis time, we propose OMNISEC, which applies large language models (LLMs) to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems via retrieval-augmented behavior prompting. OMNISEC can identify abnormal nodes and corresponding abnormal events by constructing suspicious nodes and rare paths. By combining two external knowledge bases, OMNISEC uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable the LLM to determine whether abnormal behavior is a real attack. Finally, OMNISEC can reconstruct the attack graph and restore the complete attack behavior chain of the attacker's intrusion. Experimental results show that OMNISEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Jailbreaking Large Language Diffusion Models: Revealing Hidden Safety Flaws in Diffusion-Based Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19227v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs. Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size, LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure deployment of diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |

We present PrompTrend, a system that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[KGV: Integrating Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs for Cyber Threat Intelligence Credibility Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08088v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is a crucial tool to prevent sophisticated, organized, and weaponized cyber attacks. However, few studies have focused on the credibility assessment of CTI, and this work still requires manual analysis by cybersecurity experts. In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph-based Verifier (KGV), the first framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with simple structured knowledge graphs (KGs) for automated CTI credibility assessment. Unlike entity-centric KGs, KGV constructs paragraph-level semantic graphs where nodes represent text segments connected through similarity analysis, which effectively enhances the semantic understanding ability of the model, reduces KG density and greatly improves response speed. Experimental results demonstrate that our KGV outperforms state-of-the-art fact reasoning methods on the CTI-200 dataset, achieving a 5.7\% improvement in F1. Additionally, it shows strong scalability on factual QA and fake news detection datasets. Compared to entity-based knowledge graphs (KGs) for equivalent-length texts, our structurally simple KG reduces node quantities by nearly two-thirds while boosting precision by 1.7\% and cutting response time by 46.7\%. In addition, we have created and publicly released the first CTI credibility assessment dataset, CTI-200. Distinct from CTI identification datasets, CTI-200 refines CTI summaries and key sentences to focus specifically on credibility assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[The Right to be Forgotten in Pruning: Unveil Machine Unlearning on Sparse Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18725v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology ``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main part</p></details> |
| **[On Reconstructing Training Data From Bayesian Posteriors and Trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18372v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly releasing the specification of a model with its trained parameters means an adversary can attempt to reconstruct information about the training data via training data reconstruction attacks, a major vulnerability of modern machine learning methods. This paper makes three primary contributions: establishing a mathematical framework to express the problem, characterising the features of the training data that are vulnerable via a maximum mean discrepancy equivalance and outlining a score matching framework for reconstructing data in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, the former is a first in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadReasoner: Planting Tunable Overthinking Backdoors into Large Reasoning Models for Fun or Profit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18305v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is available at https://github.com/FZaKK/BadReasoner.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Iterative cybersecurity testing is indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and training using production environment. However, the design and implementation of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been open-sourced.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Existing approaches often rely on modifying the environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
