| **[Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Graph-aware Large Language Models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04894v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al. 2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against structural attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06850v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation attacks to system-level compromise. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the security of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our results also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic LLM Red Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04451v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAIN: Hijacking LLM-Humans Conversations via Malicious System Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16888v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs' system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions (e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"), while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense. Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%. This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for enhancing model security The code and data are available at https://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Findings), camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Tool Unlearning for Tool-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01083v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of query-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly into the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to forget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or tool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in unlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing distinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal rather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs, and the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we propose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented LLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for effective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack (MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool learning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively unlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on non-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 https://clu-uml.github.io/MU-Bench-Project-Page/</p></details> |
| **[AttnTrace: Attention-based Context Traceback for Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03793v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents. In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made, state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate LLM-generated reviews.

| **[M2S: Multi-turn to Single-turn jailbreak in Red Teaming for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04856v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Track).

| **[Attack the Messages, Not the Agents: A Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering Framework for LLM-MAS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03125v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) effectively accomplish complex and dynamic tasks through inter-agent communication, but this reliance introduces substantial safety vulnerabilities. Existing attack methods targeting LLM-MAS either compromise agent internals or rely on direct and overt persuasion, which limit their effectiveness, adaptability, and stealthiness. In this paper, we propose MAST, a Multi-round Adaptive Stealthy Tampering framework designed to exploit communication vulnerabilities within the system. MAST integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Direct Preference Optimization to train an attack policy model that adaptively generates effective multi-round tampering strategies. Furthermore, to preserve stealthiness, we impose dual semantic and embedding similarity constraints during the tampering process. Comprehensive experiments across diverse tasks, communication architectures, and LLMs demonstrate that MAST consistently achieves high attack success rates while significantly enhancing stealthiness compared to baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness, and adaptability of MAST, underscoring the need for robust communication safeguards in LLM-MAS.</p></details> |  |

However, users with data privacy concerns face limitations in directly utilizing LLM APIs, while private deployments incur significant computational demands. This creates a substantial challenge in achieving secure LLM adaptation under constrained local resources. To address this issue, collaborative learning methods, such as Split Learning (SL), offer a resource-efficient and privacy-preserving solution for adapting LLMs to private domains. In this study, we introduce VFLAIR-LLM (available at https://github.com/FLAIR-THU/VFLAIR-LLM), an extensible and lightweight split learning framework for LLMs, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference and fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Our library provides two LLM partition settings, supporting three task types and 18 datasets. In addition, we provide standard modules for implementing and evaluating attacks and defenses. We benchmark 5 attacks and 9 defenses under various Split Learning for LLM(SL-LLM) settings, offering concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of model partition configurations, defense strategies, and relevant hyperparameters for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, published in KDD2025</p></details> |

However, we identify that existing defense evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3) Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust. We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new attacks/defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Although some attacks have highlighted vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations, such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process. Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block, BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

Backdoor attacks can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric: Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate, and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition systems.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 24 Figures |

While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code.

However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs. Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and deployability.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, the intensity and complexity of global cyber threats have grown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for traditional threat detection and incident response methods to operate effectively in complex network environments. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in early threat detection, their capabilities remain limited when it comes to automated incident response after an intrusion. To address this gap, we construct an incremental benchmark based on real-world incident response tasks to thoroughly evaluate the performance of LLMs in this domain. Our analysis reveals several key challenges that hinder the practical application of contemporary LLMs, including context loss, hallucinations, privacy protection concerns, and their limited ability to provide accurate, context-specific recommendations. In response to these challenges, we propose IRCopilot, a novel framework for automated incident response powered by LLMs. IRCopilot mimics the three dynamic phases of a real-world incident response team using four collaborative LLM-based session components. These components are designed with clear divisions of responsibility, reducing issues such as hallucinations and context loss. Our method leverages diverse prompt designs and strategic responsibility segmentation, significantly improving the system's practicality and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that IRCopilot outperforms baseline LLMs across key benchmarks, achieving sub-task completion rates of 150%, 138%, 136%, 119%, and 114% for various response tasks. Moreover, IRCopilot exhibits robust performance on public incident response platforms and in real-world attack scenarios, showcasing its strong applicability.</p></details> |  |

Current research predominantly focuses on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS, \underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of visual image and textually steering prompt.

While this integration leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al. 2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against structural attacks.</p></details> |  |

They are often considered intellectual property, similar to the code of a software product, because of their crucial impact on the utility. However, extracting system prompts is easily possible. As of today, there is no effective countermeasure to prevent the stealing of system prompts, and all safeguarding efforts could be evaded. In this work, we propose an alternative to conventional system prompts. We introduce prompt obfuscation to prevent the extraction of the system prompt with little overhead. The core idea is to find a representation of the original system prompt that leads to the same functionality, while the obfuscated system prompt does not contain any information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the original system prompt. We evaluate our approach by comparing our obfuscated prompt output with the output of the original prompt, using eight distinct metrics to measure the lexical, character-level, and semantic similarity. We show that the obfuscated version is constantly on par with the original one. We further perform three different deobfuscation attacks with varying attacker knowledge--covering both black-box and white-box conditions--and show that in realistic attack scenarios an attacker is unable to extract meaningful information. Overall, we demonstrate that prompt obfuscation is an effective mechanism to safeguard the intellectual property of a system prompt while maintaining the same utility as the original prompt.</p></details> |  |

However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA (UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely unexplored.</p></details> |  |

However, we identify that existing defense evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3) Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust. We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new attacks/defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment, we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively suppresses biases and improves performance.</p></details> |  |
