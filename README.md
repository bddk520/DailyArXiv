| **[Machine Unlearning Meets Adversarial Robustness via Constrained Interventions on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03567v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Such biases may stem from historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, or adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies show that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit biased outputs. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to assess LLM robustness to adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves: (i) systematically probing models across multiple tasks targeting diverse sociocultural biases, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to reveal safety vulnerabilities. To facilitate systematic benchmarking, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, named CLEAR-Bias. Our analysis, identifying DeepSeek V3 as the most reliable judge LLM, reveals that bias resilience is uneven, with age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most prominent. Some small models outperform larger ones in safety, suggesting that training and architecture may matter more than scale. However, no model is fully robust to adversarial elicitation, with jailbreak attacks using low-resource languages or refusal suppression proving effective across model families. We also find that successive LLM generations exhibit slight safety gains, while models fine-tuned for the medical domain tend to be less safe than their general-purpose counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lexo: Eliminating Stealthy Supply-Chain Attacks via LLM-Assisted Program Regeneration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14522v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software supply-chain attacks are an important and ongoing concern in the open source software ecosystem. These attacks maintain the standard functionality that a component implements, but additionally hide malicious functionality activated only when the component reaches its target environment. Lexo addresses such stealthy attacks by automatically learning and regenerating vulnerability-free versions of potentially malicious components. Lexo first generates a set of input-output pairs to model a component's full observable behavior, which it then uses to synthesize a new version of the original component. The new component implements the original functionality but avoids stealthy malicious behavior. Throughout this regeneration process, Lexo consults several distinct instances of Large Language Models (LLMs), uses correctness and coverage metrics to shepherd these instances, and guardrails their results. Our evaluation on 100+ real-world packages, including high profile stealthy supply-chain attacks, indicates that Lexo scales across multiple domains, regenerates code efficiently (<100s on average), maintains compatibility, and succeeds in eliminating malicious code in several real-world supply-chain-attacks, even in cases when a state-of-the-art LLM fails to eliminate malicious code when prompted to do so.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14381v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoreGuard: Safeguarding Foundational Capabilities of LLMs Against Model Stealing in Edge Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13903v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proprietary large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and are increasingly deployed on edge devices for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, deploying proprietary LLMs at the edge without adequate protection introduces critical security threats. Attackers can extract model weights and architectures, enabling unauthorized copying and misuse. Even when protective measures prevent full extraction of model weights, attackers may still perform advanced attacks, such as fine-tuning, to further exploit the model. Existing defenses against these threats typically incur significant computational and communication overhead, making them impractical for edge deployment. To safeguard the edge-deployed LLMs, we introduce CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient protection method. CoreGuard employs an efficient protection protocol to reduce computational overhead and minimize communication overhead via a propagation protocol. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves upper-bound security protection with negligible overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[When Style Breaks Safety: Defending LLMs Against Superficial Style Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07452v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g., formatting responses as lists), including in malicious queries. Prior jailbreak research mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations to maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in the original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first define ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing jailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we find that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation correlates with an LLM's relative attention to style patterns, which also overlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style settings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echoes of Human Malice in Agents: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Turn Online Harassment Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14207v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[One Bug, Hundreds Behind: LLMs for Large-Scale Bug Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14036v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments, which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other parts of the program. In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs, BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel. Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice, BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing prompt injection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high computational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, a detection method that is both effective and efficient. Our key observation is that the internal representation of the final token in a prompt-extracted from a specific layer of the LLM, which we term the injection-critical layer-captures distinguishing features between clean and contaminated prompts. Leveraging this insight, we train a simple linear classifier on these internal representations using a labeled set of clean and contaminated prompts. We compare PIShield against 11 baselines across 5 diverse benchmark datasets and 8 prompt injection attacks. The results demonstrate that PIShield is both highly effective and efficient, substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, we show that PIShield resists strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/weizou52/PIShield</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning for Data Collection Scheduling in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14556v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized in various private and commercial applications, e.g., traffic control, parcel delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.</p></details> |  |

Such biases may stem from historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, or adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies show that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit biased outputs. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to assess LLM robustness to adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves: (i) systematically probing models across multiple tasks targeting diverse sociocultural biases, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to reveal safety vulnerabilities. To facilitate systematic benchmarking, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, named CLEAR-Bias. Our analysis, identifying DeepSeek V3 as the most reliable judge LLM, reveals that bias resilience is uneven, with age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most prominent. Some small models outperform larger ones in safety, suggesting that training and architecture may matter more than scale. However, no model is fully robust to adversarial elicitation, with jailbreak attacks using low-resource languages or refusal suppression proving effective across model families. We also find that successive LLM generations exhibit slight safety gains, while models fine-tuned for the medical domain tend to be less safe than their general-purpose counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Guardrails--external defense mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interactions--have emerged as a promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail approaches, provide insights into optimizing their defense mechanisms, and explore their universality across attack types.

The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99% with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to SLMs.</p></details> |  |

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are a standard method of estimating the privacy risk of these systems. The risk of individual records is typically computed by evaluating MIAs in a record-specific privacy game. We analyze the record-specific privacy game commonly used for evaluating attackers under realistic assumptions (the \textit{traditional} game) -- particularly for synthetic tabular data -- and show that it averages a record's privacy risk across datasets. We show this implicitly assumes the dataset a record is part of has no impact on the record's risk, providing a misleading risk estimate when a specific model or synthetic dataset is released. Instead, we propose a novel use of the leave-one-out game, used in existing work exclusively to audit differential privacy guarantees, and call this the \textit{model-seeded} game. We formalize it and show that it provides an accurate estimate of the privacy risk posed by a given adversary for a record in its specific dataset. We instantiate and evaluate the state-of-the-art MIA for synthetic data generators in the traditional and model-seeded privacy games, and show across multiple datasets and models that the two privacy games indeed result in different risk scores, with up to 94\% of high-risk records being overlooked by the traditional game. We further show that records in smaller datasets and models not protected by strong differential privacy guarantees tend to have a larger gap between risk estimates. Taken together, our results show that the model-seeded setup yields a risk estimate specific to a certain model or synthetic dataset released and in line with the standard notion of privacy leakage from prior work, meaningfully different from the dataset-averaged risk provided by the traditional privacy game.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data Privacy Management workshop at ESORICS 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted with an A-decision to Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

| **[Stealthy Dual-Trigger Backdoors: Attacking Prompt Tuning in LM-Empowered Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14470v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of graph foundation models (GFMs), particularly those incorporating language models (LMs), has revolutionized graph learning and demonstrated remarkable performance on text-attributed graphs (TAGs). However, compared to traditional GNNs, these LM-empowered GFMs introduce unique security vulnerabilities during the unsecured prompt tuning phase that remain understudied in current research. Through empirical investigation, we reveal a significant performance degradation in traditional graph backdoor attacks when operating in attribute-inaccessible constrained TAG systems without explicit trigger node attribute optimization. To address this, we propose a novel dual-trigger backdoor attack framework that operates at both text-level and struct-level, enabling effective attacks without explicit optimization of trigger node text attributes through the strategic utilization of a pre-established text pool. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our attack maintains superior clean accuracy while achieving outstanding attack success rates, including scenarios with highly concealed single-trigger nodes. Our work highlights critical backdoor risks in web-deployed LM-empowered GFMs and contributes to the development of more robust supervision mechanisms for open-source platforms in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying proprietary LLMs at the edge without adequate protection introduces critical security threats. Attackers can extract model weights and architectures, enabling unauthorized copying and misuse. Even when protective measures prevent full extraction of model weights, attackers may still perform advanced attacks, such as fine-tuning, to further exploit the model. Existing defenses against these threats typically incur significant computational and communication overhead, making them impractical for edge deployment. To safeguard the edge-deployed LLMs, we introduce CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient protection method. CoreGuard employs an efficient protection protocol to reduce computational overhead and minimize communication overhead via a propagation protocol. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves upper-bound security protection with negligible overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Conference</p></details> |

This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing solutions for automating this mapping-rule-based systems and machine learning classifiers-suffer from critical limitations: rule-based approaches fail to adapt to novel attack variations, while machine learning methods lack contextual awareness and treat tactic-technique mapping as a syntactic matching problem rather than a reasoning task. Although Large Language Models have shown promise in cybersecurity tasks, preliminary experiments reveal that existing LLM-based methods frequently hallucinate technique names or produce decontextualized mappings due to their single-step classification approach. To address these challenges, we introduce RHINO, a novel framework that decomposes LLM-based attack analysis into three interpretable phases mirroring human reasoning: (1) behavioral abstraction, where raw logs are translated into contextualized narratives; (2) multi-role collaborative inference, generating candidate techniques by evaluating behavioral evidence against MITRE ATT&CK knowledge; and (3) validation, cross-referencing predictions with official MITRE definitions to rectify hallucinations. RHINO bridges the semantic gap between low-level observations and adversarial intent while improving output reliability through structured reasoning. We evaluate RHINO on three benchmarks across four backbone models. RHINO achieved high accuracy, with model performance ranging from 86.38% to 88.45%, resulting in relative gains from 24.25% to 76.50% across different models. Our results demonstrate that RHINO significantly enhances the interpretability and scalability of threat analysis, offering a blueprint for deploying LLMs in operational security settings.</p></details> |  |

Trigger-based watermarking methods achieve copyright protection by embedding triggers into the host DNNs. However, the attacker may remove the watermark by pruning or fine-tuning. We model this interaction as a game under conditions of information asymmetry, namely, the defender embeds a secret watermark with private knowledge, while the attacker can only access the watermarked model and seek removal. We define strategies, costs, and utilities for both players, derive the attacker's optimal pruning budget, and establish an exponential lower bound on the accuracy of watermark detection after attack. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the watermarked model, and indicate that sparse watermarking can resist removal with negligible accuracy loss. This study highlights the effectiveness of game-theoretic analysis in guiding the design of robust watermarking schemes for model copyright protection.</p></details> |  |

Such biases may stem from historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, or adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies show that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit biased outputs. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to assess LLM robustness to adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves: (i) systematically probing models across multiple tasks targeting diverse sociocultural biases, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to reveal safety vulnerabilities. To facilitate systematic benchmarking, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, named CLEAR-Bias. Our analysis, identifying DeepSeek V3 as the most reliable judge LLM, reveals that bias resilience is uneven, with age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most prominent. Some small models outperform larger ones in safety, suggesting that training and architecture may matter more than scale. However, no model is fully robust to adversarial elicitation, with jailbreak attacks using low-resource languages or refusal suppression proving effective across model families. We also find that successive LLM generations exhibit slight safety gains, while models fine-tuned for the medical domain tend to be less safe than their general-purpose counterparts.</p></details> |  |
