| **[When LLMs Copy to Think: Uncovering Copy-Guided Attacks in Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16773v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to automated code analysis, enabling tasks such as vulnerability detection and code comprehension. However, their integration introduces novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we identify and investigate a new class of prompt-based attacks, termed Copy-Guided Attacks (CGA), which exploit the inherent copying tendencies of reasoning-capable LLMs. By injecting carefully crafted triggers into external code snippets, adversaries can induce the model to replicate malicious content during inference. This behavior enables two classes of vulnerabilities: inference length manipulation, where the model generates abnormally short or excessively long reasoning traces; and inference result manipulation, where the model produces misleading or incorrect conclusions. We formalize CGA as an optimization problem and propose a gradient-based approach to synthesize effective triggers. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs shows that CGA reliably induces infinite loops, premature termination, false refusals, and semantic distortions in code analysis tasks. While highly effective in targeted settings, we observe challenges in generalizing CGA across diverse prompts due to computational constraints, posing an open question for future research. Our findings expose a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in LLM-powered development pipelines and call for urgent advances in prompt-level defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth Gives a False Sense of Privacy: LLM Internal States Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16372v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines, yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025.

| **[ShadowCode: Towards (Automatic) External Prompt Injection Attack against Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v6)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have led to the widespread adoption of code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) for programming tasks. Despite their success in deployment, their security research is left far behind. This paper introduces a new attack paradigm: (automatic) external prompt injection against Code LLMs, where attackers generate concise, non-functional induced perturbations and inject them within a victim's code context. These induced perturbations can be disseminated through commonly used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base), manipulating Code LLMs to achieve malicious objectives during the code completion process. Compared to existing attacks, this method is more realistic and threatening: it does not necessitate control over the model's training process, unlike backdoor attacks, and can achieve specific malicious objectives that are challenging for adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we propose ShadowCode, a simple yet effective method that automatically generates induced perturbations based on code simulation to achieve effective and stealthy external prompt injection. ShadowCode designs its perturbation optimization objectives by simulating realistic code contexts and employs a greedy optimization approach with two enhancement modules: forward reasoning enhancement and keyword-based perturbation design. We evaluate our method across 13 distinct malicious objectives, generating 31 threat cases spanning three popular programming languages. Our results demonstrate that ShadowCode successfully attacks three representative open-source Code LLMs (achieving up to a 97.9% attack success rate) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with over 90% attack success rate) across all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional induced perturbation. The code is available at https://github.com/LianPing-cyber/ShadowCodeEPI.</p></details> |  |
| **[OMNISEC: LLM-Driven Provenance-based Intrusion Detection via Retrieval-Augmented Behavior Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03108v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have been widely used for endpoint threat analysis. These studies can be broadly categorized into rule-based detection systems and learning-based detection systems. Among these, due to the evolution of attack techniques, rules cannot dynamically model all the characteristics of attackers. As a result, such systems often face false negatives. Learning-based detection systems are further divided into supervised learning and anomaly detection. The scarcity of attack samples hinders the usability and effectiveness of supervised learning-based detection systems in practical applications. Anomaly-based detection systems face a massive false positive problem because they cannot distinguish between changes in normal behavior and real attack behavior. The alert results of detection systems are closely related to the manual labor costs of subsequent security analysts. To reduce manual analysis time, we propose OMNISEC, which applies large language models (LLMs) to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems via retrieval-augmented behavior prompting. OMNISEC can identify abnormal nodes and corresponding abnormal events by constructing suspicious nodes and rare paths. By combining two external knowledge bases, OMNISEC uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable the LLM to determine whether abnormal behavior is a real attack. Finally, OMNISEC can reconstruct the attack graph and restore the complete attack behavior chain of the attacker's intrusion. Experimental results show that OMNISEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Talking Like a Phisher: LLM-Based Attacks on Voice Phishing Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16291v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Voice phishing (vishing) remains a persistent threat in cybersecurity, exploiting human trust through persuasive speech. While machine learning (ML)-based classifiers have shown promise in detecting malicious call transcripts, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations that preserve semantic content. In this study, we explore a novel attack vector where large language models (LLMs) are leveraged to generate adversarial vishing transcripts that evade detection while maintaining deceptive intent. We construct a systematic attack pipeline that employs prompt engineering and semantic obfuscation to transform real-world vishing scripts using four commercial LLMs. The generated transcripts are evaluated against multiple ML classifiers trained on a real-world Korean vishing dataset (KorCCViD) with statistical testing. Our experiments reveal that LLM-generated transcripts are both practically and statistically effective against ML-based classifiers. In particular, transcripts crafted by GPT-4o significantly reduce classifier accuracy (by up to 30.96%) while maintaining high semantic similarity, as measured by BERTScore. Moreover, these attacks are both time-efficient and cost-effective, with average generation times under 9 seconds and negligible financial cost per query. The results underscore the pressing need for more resilient vishing detection frameworks and highlight the imperative for LLM providers to enforce stronger safeguards against prompt misuse in adversarial social engineering contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EAI ICDF2C 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Stage Prompt Inference Attacks on Enterprise LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15613v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place. We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both attacks and defenses.</p></details> | 26 pages |

This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Coordination of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14928v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents is a promising approach to overcome inherent limitations of single-agent systems, such as hallucinations and single points of failure. As LLM agents are increasingly deployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of tolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential. Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven coordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are inherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive leaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus, forcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high latency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader can be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are available, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives a quorum of votes. To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized consensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate answers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these answers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture enables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and consistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates Byzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.</p></details> |  |

We show that adversaries can embed universal adversarial triggers in webpage HTML to hijack agent behavior that utilizes the accessibility tree to parse HTML, causing unintended or malicious actions. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm and a Browser Gym agent powered by Llama-3.1, our system demonstrates high success rates across real websites in both targeted and general attacks, including login credential exfiltration and forced ad clicks. Our empirical results highlight critical security risks and the need for stronger defenses as LLM-driven autonomous web agents become more widely adopted.

| **[Configurable multi-agent framework for scalable and realistic testing of llm-based agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14705v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing obsolete. We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like conversations that adapt after every turn. Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i) uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered 10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45 mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts. Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release the framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately.

| **[Benchmarking machine learning models for predicting aerofoil performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15993v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the capability of Neural Networks (NNs) as alternatives to the traditional methods to analyse the performance of aerofoils used in the wind and tidal energy industry. The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANSdataset benchmark is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison.

| **[Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16393v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations (AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD) approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems, this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks</p></details> | Accepted at FG 2025 |
| **[Ownership Verification of DNN Models Using White-Box Adversarial Attacks with Specified Probability Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17579v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ownership verification of deep neural network (DNN) models for image classification tasks. It allows verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |
| **[Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data, and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance. To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods -- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 Accepted |
| **[DP-TLDM: Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07842v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data from generative models emerges as the privacy-preserving data sharing solution. Such a synthetic data set shall resemble the original data without revealing identifiable private information. Till date, the prior focus on limited types of tabular synthesizers and a small number of privacy attacks, particularly on Generative Adversarial Networks, and overlooks membership inference attacks and defense strategies, i.e., differential privacy. Motivated by the conundrum of keeping high data quality and low privacy risk of synthetic data tables, we propose DPTLDM, Differentially Private Tabular Latent Diffusion Model, which is composed of an autoencoder network to encode the tabular data and a latent diffusion model to synthesize the latent tables. Following the emerging f-DP framework, we apply DP-SGD to train the auto-encoder in combination with batch clipping and use the separation value as the privacy metric to better capture the privacy gain from DP algorithms. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DPTLDM is capable of achieving a meaningful theoretical privacy guarantee while also significantly enhancing the utility of synthetic data. Specifically, compared to other DP-protected tabular generative models, DPTLDM improves the synthetic quality by an average of 35% in data resemblance, 15% in the utility for downstream tasks, and 50% in data discriminability, all while preserving a comparable level of privacy risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Erasing Conceptual Knowledge from Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02760v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce Erasure of Language Memory (ELM), a principled approach to concept-level unlearning that operates by matching distributions defined by the model's own introspective classification capabilities. Our key insight is that effective unlearning should leverage the model's ability to evaluate its own knowledge, using the language model itself as a classifier to identify and reduce the likelihood of generating content related to undesired concepts. ELM applies this framework to create targeted low-rank updates that reduce generation probabilities for concept-specific content while preserving the model's broader capabilities. We demonstrate ELM's efficacy on biosecurity, cybersecurity, and literary domain erasure tasks. Comparative evaluation reveals that ELM-modified models achieve near-random performance on assessments targeting erased concepts, while simultaneously preserving generation coherence, maintaining benchmark performance on unrelated tasks, and exhibiting strong robustness to adversarial attacks.

| **[BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While the diffusion model (DM) has been broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of its backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive studies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose \textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large language model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Attack for Bad and Good: Explain and Boost Adversarial Transferability across Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20090v5)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in cross-modality interaction, yet they also suffer adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability. We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cats Confuse Reasoning LLM: Query Agnostic Adversarial Triggers for Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01781v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the robustness of reasoning models trained for step-by-step problem solving by introducing query-agnostic adversarial triggers - short, irrelevant text that, when appended to math problems, systematically mislead models to output incorrect answers without altering the problem's semantics. We propose CatAttack, an automated iterative attack pipeline for generating triggers on a weaker, less expensive proxy model (DeepSeek V3) and successfully transfer them to more advanced reasoning target models like DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-distilled-Qwen-32B, resulting in greater than 300% increase in the likelihood of the target model generating an incorrect answer. For example, appending, "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives," to any math problem leads to more than doubling the chances of a model getting the answer wrong. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in reasoning models, revealing that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to subtle adversarial inputs, raising security and reliability concerns. The CatAttack triggers dataset with model responses is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/collinear-ai/cat-attack-adversarial-triggers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-context Learning of Vision Language Models for Detection of Physical and Digital Attacks against Face Recognition Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15285v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges, including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving generalisation in attack detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-TIFS</p></details> |
