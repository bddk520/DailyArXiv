However, existing research has focused exclusively on single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools. These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading performance on benign tasks. This work exposes novel backdoor attack surfaces that exploit agent collaboration, underscoring the need to move beyond single-agent protection.

| **[TraceAegis: Securing LLM-Based Agents via Hierarchical and Behavioral Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11203v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives. As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies. In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios: healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of abnormal behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemonAgent: Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack on LLM-based Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12575v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLM-based agents become increasingly prevalent, backdoors can be implanted into agents through user queries or environment feedback, raising critical concerns regarding safety vulnerabilities. However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits. To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly. Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

| **[DITTO: A Spoofing Attack Framework on Watermarked LLMs via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10987v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation, to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning, from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from expertly imitated ones. Our code is available at https://github.com/hsannn/ditto.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v4)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into web servers, pose a significant cybersecurity threat. Traditional ML and DL methods are often hampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA methods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves significantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger models now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[SASER: Stego attacks on open-source LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10486v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes, model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge, who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant attack effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtPerception: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak on LLMs with Recognition Pre-test](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10281v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks.

| **[MetaBreak: Jailbreaking Online LLM Services via Special Token Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10271v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging, as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated. This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively. Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also present an extension to a current jailbreak-template-based strategy and propose a novel template, showing higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 96\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  |

| **[LLMAtKGE: Large Language Models as Explainable Attackers against Knowledge Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11584v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters, which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies further validate its capability to generate explanations.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Large Language Models Are Effective Code Watermarkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11251v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defending backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous client data distributions encounters limitations balancing effectiveness and privacy-preserving, while most existing methods highly rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset. In this paper, we propose an FL backdoor defense framework, named CLIP-Fed, that utilizes the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. Our scheme overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness by integrating pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies. CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence, so that class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples are ensured and the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels is eliminated. In order to balance privacy-preserving and coverage enhancement of the dataset against diverse triggers, we further construct and augment the server dataset via using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Comparing to other existing methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in Attack Success Rate, {\em i.e.}, 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average Main Task Accuracy by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIP-Fed.</p></details> |  |

A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions, potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores the need for more advanced defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 tables, 1 figure.

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted with an A-decision to Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Equivalently, does the network correspond to a function that is surjective? In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output, including harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the networks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In this paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and linear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely used generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural architectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable vulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first}, aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and \textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I) \ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$. (II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in practical deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MarkPlugger: Generalizable Watermark Framework for Latent Diffusion Models without Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05607v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, the family of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has gained prominence for its high quality outputs and scalability. This has also raised security concerns on social media, as malicious users can create and disseminate harmful content. Existing approaches typically involve training specific components or entire generative models to embed a watermark in generated images for traceability and responsibility. However, in the fast-evolving era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the rapid iteration and modification of LDMs makes retraining with watermark models costly. To address the problem, we propose MarkPlugger, a generalizable plug-and-play watermark framework without LDM retraining. In particular, to reduce the disturbance of the watermark on the semantics of the generated image, we try to identify a watermark representation that is approaching orthogonal to the semantic in latent space, and apply an additive fusion strategy for the watermark and the semantic. Without modifying any components of the LDMs, we embed diverse watermarks in latent space, adapting to the denoising process. Our experimental findings reveal that our method effectively harmonizes image quality and watermark recovery rate. We also have validated that our method is generalized to multiple official versions and modified variants of LDMs, even without retraining the watermark model. Furthermore, it performs robustly under various attacks of different intensities.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Weather Forecasting Models: Application to Tropical Cyclone Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10140v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque, non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GenoArmory offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Additionally, we introduce GenoAdv, a new adversarial sample dataset designed to improve GFM safety. Empirically, classification models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to generative models, highlighting the impact of task type on model vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.</p></details> |  |

A recent black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters, which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies further validate its capability to generate explanations.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Large Language Models Are Effective Code Watermarkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11251v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
