| **[GPTZero: Robust Detection of LLM-Generated Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13042v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While historical considerations surrounding text authenticity revolved primarily around plagiarism, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new challenge: distinguishing human-authored from AI-generated text. This shift raises significant concerns, including the undermining of skill evaluations, the mass-production of low-quality content, and the proliferation of misinformation. Addressing these issues, we introduce GPTZero a state-of-the-art industrial AI detection solution, offering reliable discernment between human and LLM-generated text. Our key contributions include: introducing a hierarchical, multi-task architecture enabling a flexible taxonomy of human and AI texts, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on a variety of domains with granular predictions, and achieving superior robustness to adversarial attacks and paraphrasing via multi-tiered automated red teaming. GPTZero offers accurate and explainable detection, and educates users on its responsible use, ensuring fair and transparent assessment of text.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Autoencoders are Capable LLM Jailbreak Mitigators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12418v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks remain a persistent threat to large language model safety. We propose Context-Conditioned Delta Steering (CC-Delta), an SAE-based defense that identifies jailbreak-relevant sparse features by comparing token-level representations of the same harmful request with and without jailbreak context. Using paired harmful/jailbreak prompts, CC-Delta selects features via statistical testing and applies inference-time mean-shift steering in SAE latent space. Across four aligned instruction-tuned models and twelve jailbreak attacks, CC-Delta achieves comparable or better safety-utility tradeoffs than baseline defenses operating in dense latent space. In particular, our method clearly outperforms dense mean-shift steering on all four models, and particularly against out-of-distribution attacks, showing that steering in sparse SAE feature space offers advantages over steering in dense activation space for jailbreak mitigation. Our results suggest off-the-shelf SAEs trained for interpretability can be repurposed as practical jailbreak defenses without task-specific training.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Memory Injection Attacks on LLM Agents via Query-Only Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704v5)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.</p></details> | Code released |
| **[MalTool: Malicious Tool Attacks on LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12194v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a malicious tool attack, an attacker uploads a malicious tool to a distribution platform; once a user installs the tool and the LLM agent selects it during task execution, the tool can compromise the user's security and privacy. Prior work primarily focuses on manipulating tool names and descriptions to increase the likelihood of installation by users and selection by LLM agents. However, a successful attack also requires embedding malicious behaviors in the tool's code implementation, which remains largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first systematic study of malicious tool code implementations. We first propose a taxonomy of malicious tool behaviors based on the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad, tailored to LLM-agent settings. To investigate the severity of the risks posed by attackers exploiting coding LLMs to automatically generate malicious tools, we develop MalTool, a coding-LLM-based framework that synthesizes tools exhibiting specified malicious behaviors, either as standalone tools or embedded within otherwise benign implementations. To ensure functional correctness and structural diversity, MalTool leverages an automated verifier that validates whether generated tools exhibit the intended malicious behaviors and differ sufficiently from prior instances, iteratively refining generations until success. Our evaluation demonstrates that MalTool is highly effective even when coding LLMs are safety-aligned. Using MalTool, we construct two datasets of malicious tools: 1,200 standalone malicious tools and 5,287 real-world tools with embedded malicious behaviors. We further show that existing detection methods, including commercial malware detection approaches such as VirusTotal and methods tailored to the LLM-agent setting, exhibit limited effectiveness at detecting the malicious tools, highlighting an urgent need for new defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRA-based Parameter-Efficient LLMs for Continuous Learning in Edge-based Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11655v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of edge devices has created an urgent need for security solutions capable of detecting malware in real time while operating under strict computational and memory constraints. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recognizing complex patterns, yet their deployment on edge devices remains impractical due to their resource demands. However, in edge malware detection, static or centrally retrained models degrade under evolving threats and heterogeneous traffic; locally trained models become siloed and fail to transfer across domains. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we present a continuous learning architecture for edge-based malware detection that combines local adaptation on each device with global knowledge sharing through parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Lightweight transformer models (DistilBERT, DistilGPT-2, TinyT5) run on edge nodes and are incrementally fine-tuned on device-specific traffic; only the resulting LoRA modules are aggregated by a lightweight coordinator and redistributed, enabling cross-device generalization without exchanging raw data. We evaluate on two public IoT security datasets, Edge-IIoTset and TON-IoT, under multi-round learning to simulate evolving threats. Compared to isolated fine-tuning, the LoRA-based exchange yields up to 20-25% accuracy gains when models encounter previously unseen attacks from another domain, while maintaining stable loss and F1 across rounds. LoRA adds less than 1% to model size (~0.6-1.8 MB), making updates practical for constrained edge hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop Tracking Me! Proactive Defense Against Attribute Inference Attack in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11528v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can infer private user attributes (e.g., age, location, gender) from user-generated text shared online, enabling rapid and large-scale privacy breaches. Existing anonymization-based defenses are coarse-grained, lacking word-level precision in anonymizing privacy-leaking elements. Moreover, they are inherently limited as altering user text to hide sensitive cues still allows attribute inference to occur through models' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a unified defense framework that combines fine-grained anonymization (TRACE) with inference-preventing optimization (RPS). TRACE leverages attention mechanisms and inference chain generation to identify and anonymize privacy-leaking textual elements, while RPS employs a lightweight two-stage optimization strategy to induce model rejection behaviors, thereby preventing attribute inference. Evaluations across diverse LLMs show that TRACE-RPS reduces attribute inference accuracy from around 50\% to below 5\% on open-source models. In addition, our approach offers strong cross-model generalization, prompt-variation robustness, and utility-privacy tradeoffs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-Yan/TRACE-RPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[AgentLeak: A Full-Stack Benchmark for Privacy Leakage in Multi-Agent LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11510v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables.

| **[Can LLMs Handle WebShell Detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13811v5)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebShell attacks - where adversaries implant malicious scripts on web servers - remain a persistent threat. Prior machine-learning and deep-learning detectors typically depend on task-specific supervision and can be brittle under data scarcity, rapid concept drift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) deployment. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong code understanding capabilities, but their reliability for WebShell detection remains unclear. We address this gap by (i) systematically evaluating seven LLMs (including GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1-70B, and Qwen-2.5 variants) against representative sequence- and graph-based baselines on 26.59K PHP scripts, and (ii) proposing Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD), a behavior-centric framework that adapts LLM inference to WebShell-specific execution patterns. BFAD anchors analysis on security-sensitive PHP functions via a Critical Function Filter, constructs compact LLM inputs with Context-Aware Code Extraction, and selects in-context demonstrations using Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling, which ranks examples by a behavior-weighted, function-level similarity. Empirically, we observe a consistent precision-recall asymmetry: larger LLMs often achieve high precision but miss attacks (lower recall), while smaller models exhibit the opposite tendency; moreover, off-the-shelf LLM prompting underperforms established detectors. BFAD substantially improves all evaluated LLMs, boosting F1 by 13.82% on average; notably, GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1-70B, and Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B exceed prior SOTA benchmarks, while Qwen-2.5-Coder-3B becomes competitive with traditional methods. Overall, our results clarify when LLMs succeed or fail on WebShell detection, provide a practical recipe, and highlight future directions for making LLM-based detection more reliable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 (The new version has been polished and expanded with more detailed future work ideas)</p></details> |
| **[Vulnerabilities in Partial TEE-Shielded LLM Inference with Precomputed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11088v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on third-party devices requires new ways to protect model intellectual property. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a promising solution, their performance limits can lead to a critical compromise: using a precomputed, static secret basis to accelerate cryptographic operations. We demonstrate that this mainstream design pattern introduces a classic cryptographic flaw, the reuse of secret keying material, into the system's protocol. We prove its vulnerability with two distinct attacks: First, our attack on a model confidentiality system achieves a full confidentiality break by recovering its secret permutations and model weights. Second, our integrity attack completely bypasses the integrity checks of systems like Soter and TSQP. We demonstrate the practicality of our attacks against state-of-the-art LLMs, recovering a layer's secrets from a LLaMA-3 8B model in about 6 minutes and showing the attack scales to compromise 405B-parameter LLMs across a variety of configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Peak + Accumulation: A Proxy-Level Scoring Formula for Multi-Turn LLM Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11247v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn prompt injection attacks distribute malicious intent across multiple conversation turns, exploiting the assumption that each turn is evaluated independently. While single-turn detection has been extensively studied, no published formula exists for aggregating per-turn pattern scores into a conversation-level risk score at the proxy layer -- without invoking an LLM. We identify a fundamental flaw in the intuitive weighted-average approach: it converges to the per-turn score regardless of turn count, meaning a 20-turn persistent attack scores identically to a single suspicious turn. Drawing on analogies from change-point detection (CUSUM), Bayesian belief updating, and security risk-based alerting, we propose peak + accumulation scoring -- a formula combining peak single-turn risk, persistence ratio, and category diversity. Evaluated on 10,654 multi-turn conversations -- 588 attacks sourced from WildJailbreak adversarial prompts and 10,066 benign conversations from WildChat -- the formula achieves 90.8% recall at 1.20% false positive rate with an F1 of 85.9%. A sensitivity analysis over the persistence parameter reveals a phase transition at rho ~ 0.4, where recall jumps 12 percentage points with negligible FPR increase. We release the scoring algorithm, pattern library, and evaluation harness as open source.</p></details> |  |

However, there are limited studies to further verify privacy risks by reconstructing realistic high-resolution face images from embeddings of these systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we propose the face embedding mapping (FEM), a general framework that explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting the embedding-to-face attack by leveraging pre-trained Identity-Preserving diffusion model against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Based on extensive experiments, we verify that reconstructed faces can be used for accessing other real-word FR systems. Besides, the proposed method shows the robustness in reconstructing faces from the partial and protected face embeddings. Moreover, FEM can be utilized as a tool for evaluating safety of FR and PPFR systems in terms of privacy leakage. All images used in this work are from public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Prior work has extensively explored the reinforcement learning approach, which involves learning response strategies through extensive simulation of the incident. While this approach can be effective, it requires handcrafted modeling of the simulator and suppresses useful semantics from raw system logs and alerts. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage large language models' (LLM) pre-trained security knowledge and in-context learning to create an end-to-end agentic solution for incident response planning. Specifically, our agent integrates four functionalities, perception, reasoning, planning, and action, into one lightweight LLM (14b model). Through fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning, our LLM agent is capable of processing system logs and inferring the underlying network state (perception), updating its conjecture of attack models (reasoning), simulating consequences under different response strategies (planning), and generating an effective response (action). By comparing LLM-simulated outcomes with actual observations, the LLM agent repeatedly refines its attack conjecture and corresponding response, thereby demonstrating in-context adaptation. Our agentic approach is free of modeling and can run on commodity hardware. When evaluated on incident logs reported in the literature, our agent achieves recovery up to 23% faster than those of frontier LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>2026 ...</summary><p>2026 AAAI Summer Symposium on Human-Aware AI Agents for the Cyber Battlefield</p></details> |

We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction. Our results highlight that reasoning capabilities do not automatically confer adversarial robustness and that confidence-based defenses require fundamental redesign for reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.</p></details> | 30 pages,12 figures |
| **[SmartGuard: Leveraging Large Language Models for Network Attack Detection through Audit Log Analysis and Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16981v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-point monitoring solutions are widely deployed in today's enterprise environments to support advanced attack detection and investigation. These monitors continuously record system-level activities as audit logs and provide deep visibility into security events. Unfortunately, existing methods of semantic analysis based on audit logs have low granularity, only reaching the system call level, making it difficult to effectively classify highly covert behaviors. Additionally, existing works mainly match audit log streams with rule knowledge bases describing behaviors, which heavily rely on expertise and lack the ability to detect unknown attacks and provide interpretive descriptions. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an automated method that combines abstracted behaviors from audit event semantics with large language models. SmartGuard extracts specific behaviors (function level) from incoming system logs and constructs a knowledge graph, divides events by threads, and combines event summaries with graph embeddings to achieve information diagnosis and provide explanatory narratives through large language models. Our evaluation shows that SmartGuard achieves an average F1 score of 96\% in assessing malicious behaviors and demonstrates good scalability across multiple models and unknown attacks. It also possesses excellent fine-tuning capabilities, allowing experts to assist in timely system updates.</p></details> |  |

We critically ask how to achieve verifiable LLM inference, where a prover (the service) must convince a verifier (the client) that an inference was run correctly without rerunning the LLM. Existing cryptographic works are too slow at the LLM scale, while non-cryptographic ones require a strong verifier GPU. We propose TensorCommitments (TCs), a tensor-native proof-of-inference scheme. TC binds the LLM inference to a commitment, an irreversible tag that breaks under tampering, organized in our multivariate Terkle Trees. For LLaMA2, TC adds only 0.97% prover and 0.12% verifier time over inference while improving robustness to tailored LLM attacks by up to 48% over the best prior work requiring a verifier GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 AI for Music Workshop NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Creativity & Generative AI</p></details> |

We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 35 figures |
| **[Unknown Attack Detection in IoT Networks using Large Language Models: A Robust, Data-efficient Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12183v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of cyberattacks continues to drive the emergence of unknown (zero-day) threats, posing significant challenges for network intrusion detection systems in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Existing machine learning and deep learning approaches typically rely on large labeled datasets, payload inspection, or closed-set classification, limiting their effectiveness under data scarcity, encrypted traffic, and distribution shifts. Consequently, detecting unknown attacks in realistic IoT deployments remains difficult. To address these limitations, we propose SiamXBERT, a robust and data-efficient Siamese meta-learning framework empowered by a transformer-based language model for unknown attack detection. The proposed approach constructs a dual-modality feature representation by integrating flow-level and packet-level information, enabling richer behavioral modeling while remaining compatible with encrypted traffic. Through meta-learning, the model rapidly adapts to new attack types using only a small number of labeled samples and generalizes to previously unseen behaviors. Extensive experiments on representative IoT intrusion datasets demonstrate that SiamXBERT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings while requiring significantly less training data, achieving up to \num{78.8}\% improvement in unknown F1-score. These results highlight the practicality of SiamXBERT for robust unknown attack detection in real-world IoT environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment.</p></details> |  |

However, there are limited studies to further verify privacy risks by reconstructing realistic high-resolution face images from embeddings of these systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we propose the face embedding mapping (FEM), a general framework that explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting the embedding-to-face attack by leveraging pre-trained Identity-Preserving diffusion model against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Based on extensive experiments, we verify that reconstructed faces can be used for accessing other real-word FR systems. Besides, the proposed method shows the robustness in reconstructing faces from the partial and protected face embeddings. Moreover, FEM can be utilized as a tool for evaluating safety of FR and PPFR systems in terms of privacy leakage. All images used in this work are from public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
