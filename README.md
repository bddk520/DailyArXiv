| **[Get my drift? Catching LLM Task Drift with Activation Deltas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00799v6)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are commonly used in retrieval-augmented applications to execute user instructions based on data from external sources. For example, modern search engines use LLMs to answer queries based on relevant search results; email plugins summarize emails by processing their content through an LLM. However, the potentially untrusted provenance of these data sources can lead to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM is manipulated by natural language instructions embedded in the external data, causing it to deviate from the user's original instruction(s). We define this deviation as task drift. Task drift is a significant concern as it allows attackers to exfiltrate data or influence the LLM's output for other users. We study LLM activations as a solution to detect task drift, showing that activation deltas - the difference in activations before and after processing external data - are strongly correlated with this phenomenon. Through two probing methods, we demonstrate that a simple linear classifier can detect drift with near-perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We evaluate these methods by making minimal assumptions about how users' tasks, system prompts, and attacks can be phrased. We observe that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Interestingly, the fact that this solution does not require any modifications to the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning), as well as its compatibility with existing meta-prompting solutions, makes it cost-efficient and easy to deploy. To encourage further research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, featuring a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from six SoTA language models, and a suite of inspection tools.</p></details> | SaTML 2025 |
| **[Know Thy Judge: On the Robustness Meta-Evaluation of LLM Safety Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04474v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) based judges form the underpinnings of key safety evaluation processes such as offline benchmarking, automated red-teaming, and online guardrailing. This widespread requirement raises the crucial question: can we trust the evaluations of these evaluators? In this paper, we highlight two critical challenges that are typically overlooked: (i) evaluations in the wild where factors like prompt sensitivity and distribution shifts can affect performance and (ii) adversarial attacks that target the judge. We highlight the importance of these through a study of commonly used safety judges, showing that small changes such as the style of the model output can lead to jumps of up to 0.24 in the false negative rate on the same dataset, whereas adversarial attacks on the model generation can fool some judges into misclassifying 100% of harmful generations as safe ones. These findings reveal gaps in commonly used meta-evaluation benchmarks and weaknesses in the robustness of current LLM judges, indicating that low attack success under certain judges could create a false sense of security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ICBINB Workshop at ICLR'25</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Multilingual NLG Evaluation Abilities of LLM-Based Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04360v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous research has shown that LLMs have potential in multilingual NLG evaluation tasks. However, existing research has not fully explored the differences in the evaluation capabilities of LLMs across different languages. To this end, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the multilingual evaluation performance of 10 recent LLMs, spanning high-resource and low-resource languages through correlation analysis, perturbation attacks, and fine-tuning. We found that 1) excluding the reference answer from the prompt and using large-parameter LLM-based evaluators leads to better performance across various languages; 2) most LLM-based evaluators show a higher correlation with human judgments in high-resource languages than in low-resource languages; 3) in the languages where they are most sensitive to such attacks, they also tend to exhibit the highest correlation with human judgments; and 4) fine-tuning with data from a particular language yields a broadly consistent enhancement in the model's evaluation performance across diverse languages. Our findings highlight the imbalance in LLMs'evaluation capabilities across different languages and suggest that low-resource language scenarios deserve more attention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Malware Detection at the Edge with Lightweight LLMs: A Performance Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04302v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of malware attacks calls for the development of innovative detection methods, especially in resource-constrained edge computing. Traditional detection techniques struggle to keep up with modern malware's sophistication and adaptability, prompting a shift towards advanced methodologies like those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced malware detection. However, deploying LLMs for malware detection directly at edge devices raises several challenges, including ensuring accuracy in constrained environments and addressing edge devices' energy and computational limits. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an architecture leveraging lightweight LLMs' strengths while addressing limitations like reduced accuracy and insufficient computational power. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight LLM-based approach for edge computing, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation using several state-of-the-art lightweight LLMs. We test them with several publicly available datasets specifically designed for edge and IoT scenarios and different edge nodes with varying computational power and characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Using LLMs to Execute Multistage Network Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16466v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have shown preliminary promise in some security tasks and CTF challenges. However, it is unclear whether LLMs are able to realize multistage network attacks, which involve executing a wide variety of actions across multiple hosts such as conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access, leveraging internal hosts to move laterally, and using multiple compromised hosts to exfiltrate data. We evaluate LLMs across 10 multistage networks and find that popular LLMs are unable to realize these attacks. To enable LLMs to realize these attacks, we introduce Incalmo, an LLM-agnostic high-level attack abstraction layer that sits between an LLM and the environment. Rather than LLMs issuing low-level command-line instructions, which can lead to incorrect implementations, Incalmo allows LLMs to specify high-level tasks (e.g., infect a host, scan a network), which are then carried out by Incalmo. Incalmo realizes these tasks by translating them into low-level primitives (e.g., commands to exploit tools). Incalmo also provides an environment state service and an attack graph service to provide structure to LLMs in selecting actions relevant to a multistage attack. Across 9 out of 10 realistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts), LLMs using Incalmo can successfully autonomously execute multistage attacks. We also conduct an ablation analysis to show the key role the high-level abstractions play. For instance, we find that both Incalmo's high-level tasks and services are crucial. Furthermore, even smaller-parameter LLMs with Incalmo can fully succeed in 5 of 10 environments, while larger-parameter LLMs without Incalmo do not fully succeed in any.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A generative approach to LLM harmfulness detection with special red flag tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16366v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) based on fine-tuning rely on dramatically changing the output distribution of the model when faced with a harmful request, shifting it from an unsafe answer to a refusal to respond. These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03710v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

| **[A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03704v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

However, despite these achievements, LLMs still exhibit inherent safety vulnerabilities, especially when confronted with jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods suffer from two main limitations: reliance on complicated prompt engineering and iterative optimization, which lead to low attack success rate (ASR) and attack efficiency (AE). In this work, we propose an efficient jailbreak attack method, Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ), which leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLMs to autonomously generate harmful content, revealing their underlying safety vulnerabilities during complex reasoning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs. In particular, ABJ achieves high ASR (82.1% on GPT-4o-2024-11-20) with exceptional AE among all target LLMs, showcasing its remarkable attack effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency. Our findings underscore the urgent need to prioritize and improve the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Knowledge is All You Need: Last Mile Delivery for Automated Provenance-based Intrusion Detection with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03108v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes) have been widely proposed for endpoint threat analysis. However, due to the lack of systematic integration and utilization of knowledge, existing PIDSes still require significant manual intervention for practical deployment, making full automation challenging. This paper presents a disruptive innovation by categorizing PIDSes according to the types of knowledge they utilize. In response to the prevalent issue of ``knowledge silos problem'' in existing research, we introduce a novel knowledge-driven provenance-based intrusion detection framework, powered by large language models (LLMs). We also present OmniSec, a best practice system built upon this framework. By integrating attack representation knowledge, threat intelligence knowledge, and benign behavior knowledge, OmniSec outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on public benchmark datasets. OmniSec is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PIDS-with-LLM-613B.</p></details> |  |

| **[Mark Your LLM: Detecting the Misuse of Open-Source Large Language Models via Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04636v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama3 become more capable, it is crucial to develop watermarking techniques to detect their potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 1st Workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Stealthy Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models via Benign Data Mirroring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21083v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) safety is a critical issue, with numerous studies employing red team testing to enhance model security. Among these, jailbreak methods explore potential vulnerabilities by crafting malicious prompts that induce model outputs contrary to safety alignments. Existing black-box jailbreak methods often rely on model feedback, repeatedly submitting queries with detectable malicious instructions during the attack search process. Although these approaches are effective, the attacks may be intercepted by content moderators during the search process. We propose an improved transfer attack method that guides malicious prompt construction by locally training a mirror model of the target black-box model through benign data distillation. This method offers enhanced stealth, as it does not involve submitting identifiable malicious instructions to the target model during the search phase. Our approach achieved a maximum attack success rate of 92%, or a balanced value of 80% with an average of 1.5 detectable jailbreak queries per sample against GPT-3.5 Turbo on a subset of AdvBench. These results underscore the need for more robust defense mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix), integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms, UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures,15 tables</p></details> |
| **[How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks in Collaborative Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00824v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing MIA effectiveness, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI? Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical research, methodological design, and practical constraint. To overcome these limitations, we establish the first theoretical criterion formula to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE). Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens.

At the same time, it has become standard practice for machine learning practitioners to adopt publicly available pre-trained vision foundation models, effectively sharing a common backbone architecture across a multitude of applications such as classification, segmentation, depth estimation, retrieval, question-answering and more. The study of attacks on such foundation models and their impact to multiple downstream tasks remains vastly unexplored. This work proposes a general framework that forges task-agnostic adversarial examples by maximally disrupting the feature representation obtained with foundation models. We extensively evaluate the security of the feature representations obtained by popular vision foundation models by measuring the impact of this attack on multiple downstream tasks and its transferability between models.</p></details> |  |

However, despite these achievements, LLMs still exhibit inherent safety vulnerabilities, especially when confronted with jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods suffer from two main limitations: reliance on complicated prompt engineering and iterative optimization, which lead to low attack success rate (ASR) and attack efficiency (AE). In this work, we propose an efficient jailbreak attack method, Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ), which leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLMs to autonomously generate harmful content, revealing their underlying safety vulnerabilities during complex reasoning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs. In particular, ABJ achieves high ASR (82.1% on GPT-4o-2024-11-20) with exceptional AE among all target LLMs, showcasing its remarkable attack effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency. Our findings underscore the urgent need to prioritize and improve the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.</p></details> |  |

While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoBAM: LoRA-Based Backdoor Attack on Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16746v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is an emerging technique that integrates multiple models fine-tuned on different tasks to create a versatile model that excels in multiple domains. This scheme, in the meantime, may open up backdoor attack opportunities where one single malicious model can jeopardize the integrity of the merged model. Existing works try to demonstrate the risk of such attacks by assuming substantial computational resources, focusing on cases where the attacker can fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. Such an assumption, however, may not be feasible given the increasing size of machine learning models. In practice where resources are limited and the attacker can only employ techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to produce the malicious model, it remains unclear whether the attack can still work and pose threats. In this work, we first identify that the attack efficacy is significantly diminished when using LoRA for fine-tuning. Then, we propose LoBAM, a method that yields high attack success rate with minimal training resources. The key idea of LoBAM is to amplify the malicious weights in an intelligent way that effectively enhances the attack efficacy. We demonstrate that our design can lead to improved attack success rate through extensive empirical experiments across various model merging scenarios. Moreover, we show that our method is highly stealthy and is difficult to detect and defend against.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various cybersecurity applications, including CTI report understanding and attack knowledge graph construction. While previous works have proposed benchmarks that focus on the CTI extraction ability of LLMs, the sequential characteristic of adversarial behaviors within CTI reports remains largely unexplored, which holds considerable significance in developing a comprehensive understanding of how adversaries operate. To address this gap, we introduce AttackSeqBench, a benchmark tailored to systematically evaluate LLMs' capability to understand and reason attack sequences in CTI reports. Our benchmark encompasses three distinct Question Answering (QA) tasks, each task focuses on the varying granularity in adversarial behavior. To alleviate the laborious effort of QA construction, we carefully design an automated dataset construction pipeline to create scalable and well-formulated QA datasets based on real-world CTI reports. To ensure the quality of our dataset, we adopt a hybrid approach of combining human evaluation and systematic evaluation metrics. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis with both fast-thinking and slow-thinking LLMs, while highlighting their strengths and limitations in analyzing the sequential patterns in cyber attacks. The overarching goal of this work is to provide a benchmark that advances LLM-driven CTI report understanding and fosters its application in real-world cybersecurity operations.

| **[An Undetectable Watermark for Generative Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07369v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first undetectable watermarking scheme for generative image models. Undetectability ensures that no efficient adversary can distinguish between watermarked and un-watermarked images, even after making many adaptive queries. In particular, an undetectable watermark does not degrade image quality under any efficiently computable metric. Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to every prior scheme we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/PRC-Watermark.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, their deployment in clinical practice raises significant safety concerns, including the potential spread of harmful information. This study systematically assesses the vulnerabilities of seven LLMs to three advanced black-box jailbreaking techniques within medical contexts. To quantify the effectiveness of these techniques, we propose an automated and domain-adapted agentic evaluation pipeline. Experiment results indicate that leading commercial and open-source LLMs are highly vulnerable to medical jailbreaking attacks. To bolster model safety and reliability, we further investigate the effectiveness of Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) in defending against medical adversarial attacks. Our findings underscore the necessity for evolving attack methods evaluation, domain-specific safety alignment, and LLM safety-utility balancing. This research offers actionable insights for advancing the safety and reliability of AI clinicians, contributing to ethical and effective AI deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 1st Workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.</p></details> | 68 pages |
| **[Stealthy Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models via Benign Data Mirroring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21083v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) safety is a critical issue, with numerous studies employing red team testing to enhance model security. Among these, jailbreak methods explore potential vulnerabilities by crafting malicious prompts that induce model outputs contrary to safety alignments. Existing black-box jailbreak methods often rely on model feedback, repeatedly submitting queries with detectable malicious instructions during the attack search process. Although these approaches are effective, the attacks may be intercepted by content moderators during the search process. We propose an improved transfer attack method that guides malicious prompt construction by locally training a mirror model of the target black-box model through benign data distillation. This method offers enhanced stealth, as it does not involve submitting identifiable malicious instructions to the target model during the search phase. Our approach achieved a maximum attack success rate of 92%, or a balanced value of 80% with an average of 1.5 detectable jailbreak queries per sample against GPT-3.5 Turbo on a subset of AdvBench. These results underscore the need for more robust defense mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix), integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms, UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures,15 tables</p></details> |

However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing MIA effectiveness, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI? Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical research, methodological design, and practical constraint. To overcome these limitations, we establish the first theoretical criterion formula to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE). Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experimental results show that SiftFunnel outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, achieving strong privacy protection with an average accuracy loss of around 3\% and an optimal trade-off between usability, privacy, and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables.
