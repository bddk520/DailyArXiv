| **[Alignment Under Pressure: The Case for Informed Adversaries When Evaluating LLM Defenses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15738v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Federated Splitting Framework for LLMs: Security, Efficiency, and Adaptability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15683v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data, offering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security, efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks, leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2. First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs effectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware limitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show that FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and achieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Be Careful When Fine-tuning On Open-Source LLMs: Your Fine-tuning Data Could Be Secretly Stolen!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15656v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings. We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code and data used in our experiments are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Backdoor-Data-Extraction.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Your Language Model Can Secretly Write Like Humans: Contrastive Paraphrase Attacks on LLM-Generated Text Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15337v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM First-Token Predictions in Multiple-Choice Question Answering via Prefilling Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15323v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*), undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g., "*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers, while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Words to Collisions: LLM-Guided Evaluation and Adversarial Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02145v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version of the paper</p></details> |
| **[AGENTFUZZER: Generic Black-Box Fuzzing for Indirect Prompt Injection against LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05849v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses. Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments, successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including malicious sites.</p></details> |  |

This vulnerability is exacerbated in multilingual settings, where multilingual safety-aligned data is often limited. Thus, developing a guardrail capable of detecting and filtering unsafe content across diverse languages is critical for deploying LLMs in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a multilingual guardrail with reasoning for prompt classification. Our method consists of: (1) synthetic multilingual data generation incorporating culturally and linguistically nuanced variants, (2) supervised fine-tuning, and (3) a curriculum-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework that further improves performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our multilingual guardrail, MrGuard, consistently outperforms recent baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain languages by more than 15%. We also evaluate MrGuard's robustness to multilingual variations, such as code-switching and low-resource language distractors in the prompt, and demonstrate that it preserves safety judgments under these challenging conditions. The multilingual reasoning capability of our guardrail enables it to generate explanations, which are particularly useful for understanding language-specific risks and ambiguities in multilingual content moderation.</p></details> | Preprint |

Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint: 19 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Investigating Prompt Injection Attacks Against Open-Source LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14368v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks. Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response, reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models, including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over $60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, EMNLP 2025 under review</p></details> |

Benchmarking Security Policy Preservation in Large Language Model Contexts Against Indirect Attacks in Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15805v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering. Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks, highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.</p></details> |  |

Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of how jailbreaking works, which makes it hard to develop effective defense strategies. We aim to shed more light into this issue: we conduct a detailed large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and find that these disagreements stem from insufficient observation samples. In particular, we introduce \textit{safety boundary}, and we find that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside that safety boundary, where LLMs are less sensitive to harmful information. We also find that the low and the middle layers are critical in such shifts, while deeper layers have less impact. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel defense called \textbf{Activation Boundary Defense} (ABD), which adaptively constrains the activations within the safety boundary. We further use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense method to the low and the middle layers. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that ABD achieves an average DSR of over 98\% against various forms of jailbreak attacks, with less than 2\% impact on the model's general capabilities.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Previous jailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. For open-source models, SIJ achieves near 100% attack success rates on five well-known LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves an average attack success rate over 85% across five models in the GPT and Doubao series. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires mitigation. To address this, we propose a simple adaptive defense method called Self-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results.

Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge.

However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of 1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories, converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency, and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs, underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release AJailBench, including both static and optimized adversarial data, to facilitate future research: https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/AudioJailbreak</p></details> |

While previous works improved the capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e., which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its promising usage.</p></details> |  |

To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While traditional countermeasures have primarily focused on passive detection methods, this paper introduces a novel proactive defense strategy through adversarial attacks that preemptively protect facial images from being exploited by diffusion-based deepfake systems. Existing adversarial protection methods predominantly target conventional generative architectures (GANs, AEs, VAEs) and fail to address the unique challenges presented by diffusion models, which have become the predominant framework for high-quality facial deepfakes. Current diffusion-specific adversarial approaches are limited by their reliance on specific model architectures and weights, rendering them ineffective against the diverse landscape of diffusion-based deepfake implementations. Additionally, they typically employ global perturbation strategies that inadequately address the region-specific nature of facial manipulation in deepfakes.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces the use of LLMs for differential morphing attack detection (D-MAD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ multimodal LLMs to D-MAD using real biometric data. To effectively utilize these models, we design Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based prompts to reduce failure-to-answer rates and enhance the reasoning behind decisions. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of multimodal LLMs for D-MAD using real data subjects, (2) CoT-based prompt engineering to improve response reliability and explainability, (3) comprehensive qualitative and quantitative benchmarking of LLM performance using data from 54 individuals captured in passport enrollment scenarios, and (4) comparative analysis of two multimodal LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and Gemini providing insights into their morphing attack detection accuracy and decision transparency. Experimental results show that ChatGPT-4o outperforms Gemini in detection accuracy, especially against GAN-based morphs, though both models struggle under challenging conditions.

To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD), without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking Security Policy Preservation in Large Language Model Contexts Against Indirect Attacks in Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15805v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering. Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks, highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.</p></details> |  |
