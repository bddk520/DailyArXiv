| **[Exploit Tool Invocation Prompt for Tool Behavior Hijacking in LLM-Based Agentic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05755v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agentic systems leverage large language models to handle user queries, make decisions, and execute external tools for complex tasks across domains like chatbots, customer service, and software engineering. A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations. We also propose defense mechanisms to enhance TIP security in LLM-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability. This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM Generated Reviews of Scientific Publications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10248v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confusion is the Final Barrier: Rethinking Jailbreak Evaluation and Investigating the Real Misuse Threat of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16347v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Prompt Injection Attacks to LLMs via Poisoning Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14827v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attack, where an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make an Large Language Model (LLM) follow the injected prompt to perform an attacker-chosen task, represent a critical security threat. Existing attacks primarily focus on crafting these injections at inference time, treating the LLM itself as a static target. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we introduces a more foundational attack vector: poisoning the LLM's alignment process to amplify the success of future prompt injection attacks. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method that strategically creates poisoned alignment samples to poison an LLM's alignment dataset. Our experiments across five LLMs and two alignment datasets show that when even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned, the resulting model becomes substantially more vulnerable to a wide range of prompt injection attacks. Crucially, this vulnerability is instilled while the LLM's performance on standard capability benchmarks remains largely unchanged, making the manipulation difficult to detect through automated, general-purpose performance evaluations. The code for implementing the attack is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/PoisonedAlign.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Brain Restoration for Joint Quantization and Sparsification of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11177v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions: quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance. To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation. Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Character-Level Perturbations Disrupt LLM Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09112v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries. To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps, deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization. Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2026</p></details> |
| **[Harmful Prompt Laundering: Jailbreaking LLMs with Abductive Styles and Symbolic Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10931v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1) \textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[LLM in the Middle: A Systematic Review of Threats and Mitigations to Real-World LLM-based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10682v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 8 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Between a Rock and a Hard Place: Exploiting Ethical Reasoning to Jailbreak LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05367v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have undergone safety alignment efforts to mitigate harmful outputs. However, as LLMs become more sophisticated in reasoning, their intelligence may introduce new security risks. While traditional jailbreak attacks relied on singlestep attacks, multi-turn jailbreak strategies that adapt dynamically to context remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack.</p></details> |  |

| **[When MoE Meets Blockchain: A Trustworthy Distributed Framework of Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12141v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an enabling architecture of Large Models (LMs), Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become prevalent thanks to its sparsely-gated mechanism, which lowers computational overhead while maintaining learning performance comparable to dense LMs. The essence of MoE lies in utilizing a group of neural networks (called experts) with each specializing in different types of tasks, along with a trainable gating network that selectively activates a subset of these experts to handle specific tasks. Traditional cloud-based MoE encounters challenges such as prolonged response latency, high bandwidth consumption, and data privacy leakage. To address these issues, researchers have proposed to deploy MoE over distributed edge networks. However, a key concern of distributed MoE frameworks is the lack of trust in data interactions among distributed experts without the surveillance of any trusted authority, and thereby prone to potential attacks such as data manipulation. In response to the security issues of traditional distributed MoE, we propose a blockchain-aided trustworthy MoE (B-MoE) framework that consists of three layers: the edge layer, the blockchain layer, and the storage layer. In this framework, the edge layer employs the activated experts downloaded from the storage layer to process the learning tasks, while the blockchain layer functions as a decentralized trustworthy network to trace, verify, and record the computational results of the experts from the edge layer. The experimental results demonstrate that B-MoE is more robust to data manipulation attacks than traditional distributed MoE during both the training and inference processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Collaborative Defense for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11835v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models. Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation between various attack features across different languages and propose Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages: First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting strong language transfer capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/HLiang-Lee/MCD.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4figures |

However, RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Compiler is Backdooring Your Model: Understanding and Exploiting Compilation Inconsistency Vulnerabilities in Deep Learning Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11173v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) compilers are core infrastructure in modern DL systems, offering flexibility and scalability beyond vendor-specific libraries. This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+ downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation. Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently alter model semantics.

| **[Stabilizing Data-Free Model Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11159v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model extraction is a severe threat to Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems, especially through data-free approaches, where dishonest users can replicate the functionality of a black-box target model without access to realistic data. Despite recent advancements, existing data-free model extraction methods suffer from the oscillating accuracy of the substitute model. This oscillation, which could be attributed to the constant shift in the generated data distribution during the attack, makes the attack impractical since the optimal substitute model cannot be determined without access to the target model's in-distribution data. Hence, we propose MetaDFME, a novel data-free model extraction method that employs meta-learning in the generator training to reduce the distribution shift, aiming to mitigate the substitute model's accuracy oscillation. In detail, we train our generator to iteratively capture the meta-representations of the synthetic data during the attack. These meta-representations can be adapted with a few steps to produce data that facilitates the substitute model to learn from the target model while reducing the effect of distribution shifts. Our experiments on popular baseline image datasets, MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that MetaDFME outperforms the current state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method while exhibiting a more stable substitute model's accuracy during the attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>28th ...</summary><p>28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond the Protocol: Unveiling Attack Vectors in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02040v4)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard designed to enable seamless interaction between Large Language Model (LLM) applications and external tools or resources. Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end empirical evaluation of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. We identify four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate their feasibility, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload -> download -> attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent these threats. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful actions within the user's local environment, such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current MCP security ecosystem. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust security mechanisms to defend against malicious MCP servers and ensure the safe deployment of increasingly autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models are large models, trained on broad data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers (ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications. However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification, captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

| **[Bayesian Semiparametric Joint Modeling of Gap-Time Distribution for Multitype Recurrent Events and a Terminal Event](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10354v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical settings, multitype recurrent events such as stroke and heart failure occur frequently, often concluding with a terminal event such as death. Understanding the links between these recurring and terminal events is fundamental to developing interventions that delay detrimental outcomes. Joint modeling is needed to quantify the dependence between event types and between recurrent events and mortality. We propose a Bayesian semiparametric joint model on the gap-time scale for multitype recurrent events and a terminal event. The model includes a shared frailty that links all recurrent types and the terminal event. Each baseline hazard is assigned a gamma-process prior, while regression and frailty parameters receive standard parametric priors. This ensures flexible baselines and familiar effect measures. The construction gives closed-form expressions for the cumulative hazard and frailty component and connects to Breslow-Aalen type estimators as a special case of our estimator, linking the Bayesian procedure to the classical approach. Computationally, we develop a simple MCMC sampler that avoids large matrix factorizations and scales nearly linearly in sample size. A comprehensive simulation evaluates four criteria: accuracy, prediction, robustness, and computation. There is no exact frequentist version of our specification; for comparison, we fit the same model with an EM algorithm in a frequentist framework. Our model and MCMC algorithm demonstrate superior performance on each criterion. We illustrate the approach with data from the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), jointly analyzing acute and chronic cardiovascular recurrences and death.</p></details> |  |

While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code.

| **[When MoE Meets Blockchain: A Trustworthy Distributed Framework of Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12141v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an enabling architecture of Large Models (LMs), Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become prevalent thanks to its sparsely-gated mechanism, which lowers computational overhead while maintaining learning performance comparable to dense LMs. The essence of MoE lies in utilizing a group of neural networks (called experts) with each specializing in different types of tasks, along with a trainable gating network that selectively activates a subset of these experts to handle specific tasks. Traditional cloud-based MoE encounters challenges such as prolonged response latency, high bandwidth consumption, and data privacy leakage. To address these issues, researchers have proposed to deploy MoE over distributed edge networks. However, a key concern of distributed MoE frameworks is the lack of trust in data interactions among distributed experts without the surveillance of any trusted authority, and thereby prone to potential attacks such as data manipulation. In response to the security issues of traditional distributed MoE, we propose a blockchain-aided trustworthy MoE (B-MoE) framework that consists of three layers: the edge layer, the blockchain layer, and the storage layer. In this framework, the edge layer employs the activated experts downloaded from the storage layer to process the learning tasks, while the blockchain layer functions as a decentralized trustworthy network to trace, verify, and record the computational results of the experts from the edge layer. The experimental results demonstrate that B-MoE is more robust to data manipulation attacks than traditional distributed MoE during both the training and inference processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Collaborative Defense for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11835v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models. Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation between various attack features across different languages and propose Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages: First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting strong language transfer capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/HLiang-Lee/MCD.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4figures |

However, RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.</p></details> |  |

This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors after compilation. Tested on six models, three commercial compilers, and two hardware platforms, our attack yields 100% success on triggered inputs while preserving normal accuracy and remaining undetected by state-of-the-art detectors. The attack generalizes across compilers, hardware, and floating-point settings. In the natural setting, we analyze the top 100 HuggingFace models (including one with 220M+ downloads) and find natural triggers in 31 models. This shows that compilers can introduce risks even without adversarial manipulation. Our results reveal an overlooked threat: unmodified DL compilers can silently alter model semantics.
