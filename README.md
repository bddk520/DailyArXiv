| **[A Framework to Assess Multilingual Vulnerabilities of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13081v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are acquiring a wider range of capabilities, including understanding and responding in multiple languages. While they undergo safety training to prevent them from answering illegal questions, imbalances in training data and human evaluation resources can make these models more susceptible to attacks in low-resource languages (LRL). This paper proposes a framework to automatically assess the multilingual vulnerabilities of commonly used LLMs. Using our framework, we evaluated six LLMs across eight languages representing varying levels of resource availability. We validated the assessments generated by our automated framework through human evaluation in two languages, demonstrating that the framework's results align with human judgments in most cases. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in LRL; however, these may pose minimal risk as they often stem from the model's poor performance, resulting in incoherent responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[TuBA: Cross-Lingual Transferability of Backdoor Attacks in LLMs with Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19597v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implications of backdoor attacks on English-centric large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined - such attacks can be achieved by embedding malicious behaviors during training and activated under specific conditions that trigger malicious outputs. Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instruction-tuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5 and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios. Our findings also indicate that more powerful models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate 1) High Transferability: the backdoor mechanism operates successfully in cross-lingual response scenarios across 26 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 99%, and 2) Robustness: the proposed attack remains effective even after defenses are applied. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust, targeted defense strategies to address the unique challenges posed by cross-lingual backdoor transfer.</p></details> | work in progress |

Jogging the Memory of Unlearned LLMs via Benign Relearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13356v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is a promising approach to mitigate undesirable memorization of training data in ML models. However, in this work we show that existing approaches for unlearning in LLMs are surprisingly susceptible to a simple set of $\textit{benign relearning attacks}$. With access to only a small and potentially loosely related set of data, we find that we can ''jog'' the memory of unlearned models to reverse the effects of unlearning. For example, we show that relearning on public medical articles can lead an unlearned LLM to output harmful knowledge about bioweapons, and relearning general wiki information about the book series Harry Potter can force the model to output verbatim memorized text. We formalize this unlearning-relearning pipeline, explore the attack across three popular unlearning benchmarks, and discuss future directions and guidelines that result from our study. Our work indicates that current approximate unlearning methods simply suppress the model outputs and fail to robustly forget target knowledge in the LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, 32 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to these jailbreaking attacks, with success rates on GPT-4o escalating from 40% under ACE to 78% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</p></details> |  |
| **[JailGuard: A Universal Detection Framework for LLM Prompt-based Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10766v4)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The systems and software powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) have played a critical role in numerous scenarios. However, current LLM systems are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, with jailbreaking attacks enabling the LLM system to generate harmful content, while hijacking attacks manipulate the LLM system to perform attacker-desired tasks, underscoring the necessity for detection tools. Unfortunately, existing detecting approaches are usually tailored to specific attacks, resulting in poor generalization in detecting various attacks across different modalities. To address it, we propose JailGuard, a universal detection framework deployed on top of LLM systems for prompt-based attacks across text and image modalities. JailGuard operates on the principle that attacks are inherently less robust than benign ones. Specifically, JailGuard mutates untrusted inputs to generate variants and leverages the discrepancy of the variants' responses on the target model to distinguish attack samples from benign samples. We implement 18 mutators for text and image inputs and design a mutator combination policy to further improve detection generalization. The evaluation on the dataset containing 15 known attack types suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 86.14%/82.90% on text and image inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 11.81%-25.73% and 12.20%-21.40%.</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |
| **[The Power of LLM-Generated Synthetic Data for Stance Detection in Online Political Discussions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12480v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stance detection holds great potential to improve online political discussions through its deployment in discussion platforms for purposes such as content moderation, topic summarization or to facilitate more balanced discussions. Typically, transformer-based models are employed directly for stance detection, requiring vast amounts of data. However, the wide variety of debate topics in online political discussions makes data collection particularly challenging. LLMs have revived stance detection, but their online deployment in online political discussions faces challenges like inconsistent outputs, biases, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We show how LLM-generated synthetic data can improve stance detection for online political discussions by using reliable traditional stance detection models for online deployment, while leveraging the text generation capabilities of LLMs for synthetic data generation in a secure offline environment. To achieve this, (i) we generate synthetic data for specific debate questions by prompting a Mistral-7B model and show that fine-tuning with the generated synthetic data can substantially improve the performance of stance detection, while remaining interpretable and aligned with real world data. (ii) Using the synthetic data as a reference, we can improve performance even further by identifying the most informative samples in an unlabelled dataset, i.e., those samples which the stance detection model is most uncertain about and can benefit from the most. By fine-tuning with both synthetic data and the most informative samples, we surpass the performance of the baseline model that is fine-tuned on all true labels, while labelling considerably less data.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Spotlight |

To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. All scripts required to reproduce the dataset, along with examples and relevant resources for replicating our results, will be made available upon the paper's acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is submitted to "The 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval" and is currently under review</p></details> |

With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors.

| **[A Survey on Trustworthy LLM Agents: Threats and Countermeasures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09648v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents and Multi-agent Systems (MAS) have significantly expanded the capabilities of LLM ecosystems. This evolution stems from empowering LLMs with additional modules such as memory, tools, environment, and even other agents. However, this advancement has also introduced more complex issues of trustworthiness, which previous research focused solely on LLMs could not cover. In this survey, we propose the TrustAgent framework, a comprehensive study on the trustworthiness of agents, characterized by modular taxonomy, multi-dimensional connotations, and technical implementation. By thoroughly investigating and summarizing newly emerged attacks, defenses, and evaluation methods for agents and MAS, we extend the concept of Trustworthy LLM to the emerging paradigm of Trustworthy Agent. In TrustAgent, we begin by deconstructing and introducing various components of the Agent and MAS. Then, we categorize their trustworthiness into intrinsic (brain, memory, and tool) and extrinsic (user, agent, and environment) aspects. Subsequently, we delineate the multifaceted meanings of trustworthiness and elaborate on the implementation techniques of existing research related to these internal and external modules. Finally, we present our insights and outlook on this domain, aiming to provide guidance for future endeavors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</p></details> | 4 figures |

Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ICLR 2025 Workshop on GenAI Watermarking</p></details> |

| **[Booster: Tackling Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Attenuating Harmful Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01586v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harmful fine-tuning attack poses serious safety concerns for large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. To this end, we in this paper show that harmful perturbation over the model weights could be a probable cause of alignment-broken. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction after the simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/Booster.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProDiF: Protecting Domain-Invariant Features to Secure Pre-Trained Models Against Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13224v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained models are valuable intellectual property, capturing both domain-specific and domain-invariant features within their weight spaces. However, model extraction attacks threaten these assets by enabling unauthorized source-domain inference and facilitating cross-domain transfer via the exploitation of domain-invariant features. In this work, we introduce **ProDiF**, a novel framework that leverages targeted weight space manipulation to secure pre-trained models against extraction attacks. **ProDiF** quantifies the transferability of filters and perturbs the weights of critical filters in unsecured memory, while preserving actual critical weights in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for authorized users. A bi-level optimization further ensures resilience against adaptive fine-tuning attacks. Experimental results show that **ProDiF** reduces source-domain accuracy to near-random levels and decreases cross-domain transferability by 74.65\%, providing robust protection for pre-trained models. This work offers comprehensive protection for pre-trained DNN models and highlights the potential of weight space manipulation as a novel approach to model security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the ICLR Workshop on Neural Network Weights as a New Data Modality 2025</p></details> |
| **[How Good is my Histopathology Vision-Language Foundation Model? A Holistic Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12990v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have gained popularity due to their enhanced performance and generalizability across different downstream tasks. However, most existing histopathology benchmarks are either unimodal or limited in terms of diversity of clinical tasks, organs, and acquisition instruments, as well as their partial availability to the public due to patient data privacy. As a consequence, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of existing histopathology VLMs on a unified benchmark setting that better reflects a wide range of clinical scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce HistoVL, a fully open-source comprehensive benchmark comprising images acquired using up to 11 various acquisition tools that are paired with specifically crafted captions by incorporating class names and diverse pathology descriptions. Our Histo-VL includes 26 organs, 31 cancer types, and a wide variety of tissue obtained from 14 heterogeneous patient cohorts, totaling more than 5 million patches obtained from over 41K WSIs viewed under various magnification levels. We systematically evaluate existing histopathology VLMs on Histo-VL to simulate diverse tasks performed by experts in real-world clinical scenarios. Our analysis reveals interesting findings, including large sensitivity of most existing histopathology VLMs to textual changes with a drop in balanced accuracy of up to 25% in tasks such as Metastasis detection, low robustness to adversarial attacks, as well as improper calibration of models evident through high ECE values and low model prediction confidence, all of which can affect their clinical implementation.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates label memorization in binary classification models through two novel passive label inference attacks (BLIA). These attacks operate passively, relying solely on the outputs of pre-trained models, such as confidence scores and log-loss values, without interacting with or modifying the training process. By intentionally flipping 50% of the labels in controlled subsets, termed "canaries," we evaluate the extent of label memorization under two conditions: models trained without label differential privacy (Label-DP) and those trained with randomized response-based Label-DP. Despite the application of varying degrees of Label-DP, the proposed attacks consistently achieve success rates exceeding 50%, surpassing the baseline of random guessing and conclusively demonstrating that models memorize training labels, even when these labels are deliberately uncorrelated with the features.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Model Stealing Attack Against Multi-Exit Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13584v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to traditional neural networks with a single output channel, a multi-exit network has multiple exits that allow for early outputs from the model's intermediate layers, thus significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining similar main task accuracy. Existing model stealing attacks can only steal the model's utility while failing to capture its output strategy, i.e., a set of thresholds used to determine from which exit to output. This leads to a significant decrease in computational efficiency for the extracted model, thereby losing the advantage of multi-exit networks. In this paper, we propose the first model stealing attack against multi-exit networks to extract both the model utility and the output strategy. We employ Kernel Density Estimation to analyze the target model's output strategy and use performance loss and strategy loss to guide the training of the extracted model. Furthermore, we design a novel output strategy search algorithm to maximize the consistency between the victim model and the extracted model's output behaviors. In experiments across multiple multi-exit networks and benchmark datasets, our method always achieves accuracy and efficiency closest to the victim models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the efficacy of a constrained optimisation approach to adversarial attacks, one cannot trace how an adversarial point was generated. In this work, we propose an algebraic approach to adversarial attacks and study the conditions under which one can generate adversarial examples for post-hoc explainability models. Phrasing neural networks in the framework of geometric deep learning, algebraic adversarial attacks are constructed through analysis of the symmetry groups of neural networks. Algebraic adversarial examples provide a mathematically tractable approach to adversarial examples. We validate our approach of algebraic adversarial examples on two well-known and one real-world dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, their black-box nature raises concerns about potential risks. One such risk is a poisoning attack, where an attacker intentionally contaminates the training set with malicious samples to mislead the model's predictions in specific scenarios. To protect source code models from poisoning attacks, we introduce CodeGarrison (CG), a hybrid deep-learning model that relies on code embeddings to identify poisoned code samples. We evaluated CG against the state-of-the-art technique ONION for detecting poisoned samples generated by DAMP, MHM, ALERT, as well as a novel poisoning technique named CodeFooler. Results showed that CG significantly outperformed ONION with an accuracy of 93.5%. We also tested CG's robustness against unknown attacks, achieving an average accuracy of 85.6% in identifying poisoned samples across the four attacks mentioned above.</p></details> |  |

It is challenging to timely prevent such model-stealing attacks to achieve strong protection and maintain utility. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric detector called Account-aware Distribution Discrepancy (ADD) to recognize queries from malicious users by leveraging account-wise local dependency. We formulate each class as a Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) in the feature space and measure the malicious score as the sum of weighted class-wise distribution discrepancy. The ADD detector is combined with random-based prediction poisoning to yield a plug-and-play defense module named D-ADD for image classification models. Results of extensive experimental studies show that D-ADD achieves strong defense against different types of attacks with little interference in serving benign users for both soft and hard-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, published in AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[h4rm3l: A language for Composable Jailbreak Attack Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04811v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their demonstrated valuable capabilities, state-of-the-art (SOTA) widely deployed large language models (LLMs) still have the potential to cause harm to society due to the ineffectiveness of their safety filters, which can be bypassed by prompt transformations called jailbreak attacks. Current approaches to LLM safety assessment, which employ datasets of templated prompts and benchmarking pipelines, fail to cover sufficiently large and diverse sets of jailbreak attacks, leading to the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. Recent research showed that novel jailbreak attacks could be derived by composition; however, a formal composable representation for jailbreak attacks, which, among other benefits, could enable the exploration of a large compositional space of jailbreak attacks through program synthesis methods, has not been previously proposed. We introduce h4rm3l, a novel approach that addresses this gap with a human-readable domain-specific language (DSL). Our framework comprises: (1) The h4rm3l DSL, which formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized string transformation primitives. (2) A synthesizer with bandit algorithms that efficiently generates jailbreak attacks optimized for a target black box LLM. (3) The h4rm3l red-teaming software toolkit that employs the previous two components and an automated harmful LLM behavior classifier that is strongly aligned with human judgment. We demonstrate h4rm3l's efficacy by synthesizing a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 SOTA open-source and proprietary LLMs, and by benchmarking those models against a subset of these synthesized attacks. Our results show that h4rm3l's synthesized attacks are diverse and more successful than existing jailbreak attacks in literature, with success rates exceeding 90% on SOTA LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to the development of numerous phishing webpage detection solutions, but these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Evaluating their robustness against adversarial phishing webpages is essential. Existing tools contain datasets of pre-designed phishing webpages for a limited number of brands, and lack diversity in phishing features. To address these challenges, we develop PhishOracle, a tool that generates adversarial phishing webpages by embedding diverse phishing features into legitimate webpages. We evaluate the robustness of three existing task-specific models -- Stack model, VisualPhishNet, and Phishpedia -- against PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages and observe a significant drop in their detection rates. In contrast, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based phishing detector demonstrates stronger robustness against these adversarial attacks but still is prone to evasion. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of phishing detection models to adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for more robust detection approaches. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to evaluate whether PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages can deceive users. The results show that many of these phishing webpages evade not only existing detection models but also users. We also develop the PhishOracle web app, allowing users to input a legitimate URL, select relevant phishing features and generate a corresponding phishing webpage. All resources will be made publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

While existing defenses have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. To this end, we in this paper show that harmful perturbation over the model weights could be a probable cause of alignment-broken. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction after the simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/Booster.</p></details> |  |

Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ICLR 2025 Workshop on GenAI Watermarking</p></details> |
