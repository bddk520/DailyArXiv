| **[A comprehensive study of LLM-based argument classification: from LLAMA through GPT-4o to Deepseek-R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoX: Low-Rank Extrapolation Robustifies LLM Safety Against Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15606v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.</p></details> |  |

Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First, it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18 million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017 and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Vulnerability Generation with LLMs: An Investigation Beyond Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10054v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet their behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly understood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities, this study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code samples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, Gemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of generated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate the requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences. Gemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic Prompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most balanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas (e.g., "DevOps Engineer") consistently elicit higher success rates than student personas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is inverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction accuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a moderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over semantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments, particularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used. Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables. Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLMs Copy to Think: Uncovering Copy-Guided Attacks in Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16773v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to automated code analysis, enabling tasks such as vulnerability detection and code comprehension. However, their integration introduces novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we identify and investigate a new class of prompt-based attacks, termed Copy-Guided Attacks (CGA), which exploit the inherent copying tendencies of reasoning-capable LLMs. By injecting carefully crafted triggers into external code snippets, adversaries can induce the model to replicate malicious content during inference. This behavior enables two classes of vulnerabilities: inference length manipulation, where the model generates abnormally short or excessively long reasoning traces; and inference result manipulation, where the model produces misleading or incorrect conclusions. We formalize CGA as an optimization problem and propose a gradient-based approach to synthesize effective triggers. Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs shows that CGA reliably induces infinite loops, premature termination, false refusals, and semantic distortions in code analysis tasks. While highly effective in targeted settings, we observe challenges in generalizing CGA across diverse prompts due to computational constraints, posing an open question for future research. Our findings expose a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in LLM-powered development pipelines and call for urgent advances in prompt-level defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth Gives a False Sense of Privacy: LLM Internal States Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16372v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines, yet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025.

| **[ShadowCode: Towards (Automatic) External Prompt Injection Attack against Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v6)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have led to the widespread adoption of code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) for programming tasks. Despite their success in deployment, their security research is left far behind. This paper introduces a new attack paradigm: (automatic) external prompt injection against Code LLMs, where attackers generate concise, non-functional induced perturbations and inject them within a victim's code context. These induced perturbations can be disseminated through commonly used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base), manipulating Code LLMs to achieve malicious objectives during the code completion process. Compared to existing attacks, this method is more realistic and threatening: it does not necessitate control over the model's training process, unlike backdoor attacks, and can achieve specific malicious objectives that are challenging for adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we propose ShadowCode, a simple yet effective method that automatically generates induced perturbations based on code simulation to achieve effective and stealthy external prompt injection. ShadowCode designs its perturbation optimization objectives by simulating realistic code contexts and employs a greedy optimization approach with two enhancement modules: forward reasoning enhancement and keyword-based perturbation design. We evaluate our method across 13 distinct malicious objectives, generating 31 threat cases spanning three popular programming languages. Our results demonstrate that ShadowCode successfully attacks three representative open-source Code LLMs (achieving up to a 97.9% attack success rate) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with over 90% attack success rate) across all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional induced perturbation.

| **[OMNISEC: LLM-Driven Provenance-based Intrusion Detection via Retrieval-Augmented Behavior Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03108v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have been widely used for endpoint threat analysis. These studies can be broadly categorized into rule-based detection systems and learning-based detection systems. Among these, due to the evolution of attack techniques, rules cannot dynamically model all the characteristics of attackers. As a result, such systems often face false negatives. Learning-based detection systems are further divided into supervised learning and anomaly detection. The scarcity of attack samples hinders the usability and effectiveness of supervised learning-based detection systems in practical applications. Anomaly-based detection systems face a massive false positive problem because they cannot distinguish between changes in normal behavior and real attack behavior. The alert results of detection systems are closely related to the manual labor costs of subsequent security analysts. To reduce manual analysis time, we propose OMNISEC, which applies large language models (LLMs) to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems via retrieval-augmented behavior prompting. OMNISEC can identify abnormal nodes and corresponding abnormal events by constructing suspicious nodes and rare paths. By combining two external knowledge bases, OMNISEC uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable the LLM to determine whether abnormal behavior is a real attack. Finally, OMNISEC can reconstruct the attack graph and restore the complete attack behavior chain of the attacker's intrusion. Experimental results show that OMNISEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning (ML)-based classifiers have shown promise in detecting malicious call transcripts, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations that preserve semantic content. In this study, we explore a novel attack vector where large language models (LLMs) are leveraged to generate adversarial vishing transcripts that evade detection while maintaining deceptive intent. We construct a systematic attack pipeline that employs prompt engineering and semantic obfuscation to transform real-world vishing scripts using four commercial LLMs. The generated transcripts are evaluated against multiple ML classifiers trained on a real-world Korean vishing dataset (KorCCViD) with statistical testing. Our experiments reveal that LLM-generated transcripts are both practically and statistically effective against ML-based classifiers. In particular, transcripts crafted by GPT-4o significantly reduce classifier accuracy (by up to 30.96%) while maintaining high semantic similarity, as measured by BERTScore. Moreover, these attacks are both time-efficient and cost-effective, with average generation times under 9 seconds and negligible financial cost per query. The results underscore the pressing need for more resilient vishing detection frameworks and highlight the imperative for LLM providers to enforce stronger safeguards against prompt misuse in adversarial social engineering contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EAI ICDF2C 2025</p></details> |

The defining characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning process, without degrading the final answer's correctness.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings). We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Iterative cybersecurity testing is indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and training using production environment. However, the design and implementation of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been open-sourced.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Policy Disruption in Reinforcement Learning:Adversarial Attack with Large Language Models and Critical State Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18113v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trigger without Trace: Towards Stealthy Backdoor Attack on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17724v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks targeting text-to-image diffusion models have advanced rapidly. However, current backdoor samples often exhibit two key abnormalities compared to benign samples: 1) Semantic Consistency, where backdoor prompts tend to generate images with similar semantic content even with significant textual variations to the prompts; 2) Attention Consistency, where the trigger induces consistent structural responses in the cross-attention maps. These consistencies leave detectable traces for defenders, making backdoors easier to identify. In this paper, toward stealthy backdoor samples, we propose Trigger without Trace (TwT) by explicitly mitigating these consistencies. Specifically, our approach leverages syntactic structures as backdoor triggers to amplify the sensitivity to textual variations, effectively breaking down the semantic consistency. Besides, a regularization method based on Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KMMD) is proposed to align the distribution of cross-attention responses between backdoor and benign samples, thereby disrupting attention consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 97.5% attack success rate while exhibiting stronger resistance to defenses. It achieves an average of over 98% backdoor samples bypassing three state-of-the-art detection mechanisms, revealing the vulnerabilities of current backdoor defense methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Robin-WZQ/TwT.</p></details> |  |
| **[RECALLED: An Unbounded Resource Consumption Attack on Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18053v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap, we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall} adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26 $\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense development against RCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Removing Box-Free Watermarks for Image-to-Image Models via Query-Based Reverse Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18034v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intellectual property of deep generative networks (GNets) can be protected using a cascaded hiding network (HNet) which embeds watermarks (or marks) into GNet outputs, known as box-free watermarking. Although both GNet and HNet are encapsulated in a black box (called operation network, or ONet), with only the generated and marked outputs from HNet being released to end users and deemed secure, in this paper, we reveal an overlooked vulnerability in such systems. Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still be reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the generated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the system. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet under the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the query process with specially curated input images. While effective, this method yields unsatisfactory image quality. To improve this, we subsequently propose an alternative method leveraging the equivalent additive property of box-free model watermarking and reverse-engineering a forward surrogate model of HNet, with better image quality preservation. Extensive experimental results on image processing and image generation tasks demonstrate that both attacks achieve impressive watermark removal success rates (100%) while also maintaining excellent image quality (reaching the highest PSNR of 34.69 dB), substantially outperforming existing attacks, highlighting the urgent need for robust defensive strategies to mitigate the identified vulnerability in box-free model watermarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Seed to Harvest: Augmenting Human Creativity with AI for Red-teaming Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17922v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28 entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for continuous T2I model safety evaluation.</p></details> |  |
