| **[$α^3$-SecBench: A Large-Scale Evaluation Suite of Security, Resilience, and Trust for LLM-based UAV Agents over 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18754v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical, networked environments where they must operate reliably in the presence of malicious adversaries. While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings. We introduce $α^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $α^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $α^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage). We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making. We release $α^{3}$-SecBench on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/AlphaSecBench</p></details> |  |
| **[TriPlay-RL: Tri-Role Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for LLM Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18292v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, safety risks associated with large language models have become increasingly prominent, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate the generation of toxic and harmful content. The mainstream paradigm for LLM safety alignment typically adopts a collaborative framework involving three roles: an attacker for adversarial prompt generation, a defender for safety defense, and an evaluator for response assessment. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop reinforcement learning framework called TriPlay-RL that enables iterative and co-improving collaboration among three roles with near-zero manual annotation. Experimental results show that the attacker preserves high output diversity while achieving a 20%-50% improvement in adversarial effectiveness; the defender attains 10%-30% gains in safety performance without degrading general reasoning capability; and the evaluator continuously refines its fine-grained judgment ability through iterations, accurately distinguishing unsafe responses, simple refusals, and useful guidance. Overall, our framework establishes an efficient and scalable paradigm for LLM safety alignment, enabling continuous co-evolution within a unified learning loop.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttenMIA: LLM Membership Inference Attack through Attention Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18110v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to enable or improve a multitude of real-world applications. Given the large size of their training data sets, their tendency to memorize training data raises serious privacy and intellectual property concerns. A key threat is the membership inference attack (MIA), which aims to determine whether a given sample was included in the model's training set. Existing MIAs for LLMs rely primarily on output confidence scores or embedding-based features, but these signals are often brittle, leading to limited attack success. We introduce AttenMIA, a new MIA framework that exploits self-attention patterns inside the transformer model to infer membership. Attention controls the information flow within the transformer, exposing different patterns for memorization that can be used to identify members of the dataset. Our method uses information from attention heads across layers and combines them with perturbation-based divergence metrics to train an effective MIA classifier. Using extensive experiments on open-source models including LLaMA-2, Pythia, and Opt models, we show that attention-based features consistently outperform baselines, particularly under the important low-false-positive metric (e.g., achieving up to 0.996 ROC AUC & 87.9% TPR@1%FPR on the WikiMIA-32 benchmark with Llama2-13b). We show that attention signals generalize across datasets and architectures, and provide a layer- and head-level analysis of where membership leakage is most pronounced. We also show that using AttenMIA to replace other membership inference attacks in a data extraction framework results in training data extraction attacks that outperform the state of the art. Our findings reveal that attention mechanisms, originally introduced to enhance interpretability, can inadvertently amplify privacy risks in LLMs, underscoring the need for new defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreak-as-a-Service++: Unveiling Distributed AI-Driven Malicious Information Campaigns Powered by LLM Crowdsourcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21184v4)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To prevent the misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) for malicious purposes, numerous efforts have been made to develop the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs. However, as multiple LLMs become readily accessible through various Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms, attackers can strategically exploit LLMs' heterogeneous safety policies to fulfill malicious information generation tasks in a distributed manner. In this study, we introduce \textit{\textbf{PoisonSwarm}} to how attackers can reliably launder malicious tasks via the speculative use of LLM crowdsourcing. Building upon a scheduler orchestrating crowdsourced LLMs, PoisonSwarm maps the given malicious task to a benign analogue to derive a content template, decomposes it into semantic units for crowdsourced unit-wise rewriting, and reassembles the outputs into malicious content. Experiments show its superiority over existing methods in data quality, diversity, and success rates. Regulation simulations further reveal the difficulty of governing such distributed, orchestrated misuse in MaaS ecosystems, highlighting the need for coordinated, ecosystem-level defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Protocol: Security Analysis of the Model Context Protocol Specification and Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities in Tool-Integrated LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17549v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a de facto standard for integrating Large Language Models with external tools, yet no formal security analysis of the protocol specification exists. We present the first rigorous security analysis of MCP's architectural design, identifying three fundamental protocol-level vulnerabilities: (1) absence of capability attestation allowing servers to claim arbitrary permissions, (2) bidirectional sampling without origin authentication enabling server-side prompt injection, and (3) implicit trust propagation in multi-server configurations. We implement \textsc{MCPBench}, a novel framework bridging existing agent security benchmarks to MCP-compliant infrastructure, enabling direct measurement of protocol-specific attack surfaces. Through controlled experiments on 847 attack scenarios across five MCP server implementations, we demonstrate that MCP's architectural choices amplify attack success rates by 23--41\% compared to equivalent non-MCP integrations. We propose \textsc{MCPSec}, a backward-compatible protocol extension adding capability attestation and message authentication, reducing attack success rates from 52.8\% to 12.4\% with median latency overhead of 8.3ms per message. Our findings establish that MCP's security weaknesses are architectural rather than implementation-specific, requiring protocol-level remediation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token Buncher: Shielding LLMs from Harmful Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20697v2)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate more advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response entropy. By constraining entropy, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task performance and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Hompage: https://tokenbuncher.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[PIShield: Detecting Prompt Injection Attacks via Intrinsic LLM Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14005v3)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-integrated applications are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where an attacker contaminates the input to inject malicious instructions, causing the LLM to follow the attacker's intent instead of the original user's. Existing prompt injection detection methods often have sub-optimal performance and/or high computational overhead. In this work, we propose PIShield, an effective and efficient detection method based on the observation that instruction-tuned LLMs internally encode distinguishable signals for prompts containing injected instructions. PIShield leverages residual-stream representations and a simple linear classifier to detect prompt injection, without expensive model fine-tuning or response generation. We conduct extensive evaluations on a diverse set of short- and long-context benchmarks. The results show that PIShield consistently achieves low false positive and false negative rates, significantly outperforming existing baselines. These findings demonstrate that internal representations of instruction-tuned LLMs provide a powerful and practical foundation for prompt injection detection in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/weizou52/PIShield</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Collaborate: An Orchestrated-Decentralized Framework for Peer-to-Peer LLM Federation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17133v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026. 13 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables.

Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Jailbreak Detection for (Almost) Free!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14558v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) enhance security through alignment when widely used, but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks capable of producing inappropriate content. Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings) https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-emnlp.309/</p></details> |

While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings.

| **[CtrlRAG: Black-box Document Poisoning Attacks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06950v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance response credibility and traceability by displaying reference contexts, but this transparency simultaneously introduces a novel black-box attack vector. Existing document poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious documents into the knowledge base to manipulate RAG outputs, rely primarily on unrealistic white-box or gray-box assumptions, limiting their practical applicability. To address this gap, we propose CtrlRAG, a two-stage black-box attack that (1) constructs malicious documents containing misinformation or emotion-inducing content and injects them into the knowledge base, and (2) iteratively optimizes them using a localization algorithm and Masked Language Model (MLM) guided on reference context feedback, ensuring their retrieval priority while preserving linguistic naturalness. With only five malicious documents per target question injected into the million-document MS MARCO dataset, CtrlRAG achieves up to 90% attack success rates on commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), a 30% improvement over optimal baselines, in both *Emotion Manipulation* and *Hallucination Amplification* tasks. Furthermore, we show that existing defenses fail to balance security and performance. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a dynamic *Knowledge Expansion* defense strategy based on *Parametric/Non-parametric Memory Confrontation*, blocking 78% of attacks while maintaining 95.5% system accuracy. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems and provide effective defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

While significant research has focused on mitigating the data privacy risks of LLMs during various stages of model training, less attention has been paid to new threats emerging from their deployment. The integration of LLMs into widely used applications and the weaponization of their autonomous abilities have created new privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for both inadvertent data leakage and malicious exfiltration from LLM-powered systems. Additionally, adversaries can exploit these systems to launch sophisticated, large-scale privacy attacks, threatening not only individual privacy but also financial security and societal trust. In this paper, we systematically examine these emerging privacy risks of LLMs. We also discuss potential mitigation strategies and call for the research community to broaden its focus beyond data privacy risks, developing new defenses to address the evolving threats posed by increasingly powerful LLMs and LLM-powered systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin: http://sites.computer.org/debull/A25dec/issue1.htm</p></details> |

Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/DSSmoothing.</p></details> | 12 pages, 21 figures |

However, this reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the vulnerability of APR systems to such attacks. Our demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum of strategies, ranging from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these against a leading LLM-based APR system and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current defenses are insufficient: 90% of crafted bug reports triggered attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47%, while post-repair analysis -- often requiring human oversight -- was effective in just 58% of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone. We conclude with recommendations for improving the robustness of APR systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on secure APR.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has explored prompt-based attacks such as ReCALL, these methods rely heavily on the assumption that using known non-members as prompts reliably suppresses the model's responses to non-member queries. We propose EM-MIA, a new membership inference approach that iteratively refines prefix effectiveness and membership scores using an expectation-maximization strategy without requiring labeled non-member examples. To support controlled evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a benchmark that enables analysis of MIA robustness under systematically varied distributional overlap and difficulty. Experiments on WikiMIA and OLMoMIA show that EM-MIA outperforms existing baselines, particularly in settings with clear distributional separability. We highlight scenarios where EM-MIA succeeds in practical settings with partial distributional overlap, while failure cases expose fundamental limitations of current MIA methods under near-identical conditions. We release our code and evaluation pipeline to encourage reproducible and robust MIA research.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |

Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems.</p></details> |  |

We present the first rigorous security analysis of MCP's architectural design, identifying three fundamental protocol-level vulnerabilities: (1) absence of capability attestation allowing servers to claim arbitrary permissions, (2) bidirectional sampling without origin authentication enabling server-side prompt injection, and (3) implicit trust propagation in multi-server configurations. We implement \textsc{MCPBench}, a novel framework bridging existing agent security benchmarks to MCP-compliant infrastructure, enabling direct measurement of protocol-specific attack surfaces. Through controlled experiments on 847 attack scenarios across five MCP server implementations, we demonstrate that MCP's architectural choices amplify attack success rates by 23--41\% compared to equivalent non-MCP integrations. We propose \textsc{MCPSec}, a backward-compatible protocol extension adding capability attestation and message authentication, reducing attack success rates from 52.8\% to 12.4\% with median latency overhead of 8.3ms per message. Our findings establish that MCP's security weaknesses are architectural rather than implementation-specific, requiring protocol-level remediation.</p></details> |  |
| **[OTI: A Model-free and Visually Interpretable Measure of Image Attackability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17536v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of neural networks, benign images can be corrupted by adversarial perturbations to deceive these models. Intriguingly, images differ in their attackability. Specifically, given an attack configuration, some images are easily corrupted, whereas others are more resistant. Evaluating image attackability has important applications in active learning, adversarial training, and attack enhancement. This prompts a growing interest in developing attackability measures. However, existing methods are scarce and suffer from two major limitations: (1) They rely on a model proxy to provide prior knowledge (e.g., gradients or minimal perturbation) to extract model-dependent image features. Unfortunately, in practice, many task-specific models are not readily accessible. (2) Extracted features characterizing image attackability lack visual interpretability, obscuring their direct relationship with the images. To address these, we propose a novel Object Texture Intensity (OTI), a model-free and visually interpretable measure of image attackability, which measures image attackability as the texture intensity of the image's semantic object. Theoretically, we describe the principles of OTI from the perspectives of decision boundaries as well as the mid- and high-frequency characteristics of adversarial perturbations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OTI is effective and computationally efficient. In addition, our OTI provides the adversarial machine learning community with a visual understanding of attackability.</p></details> |  |

While recent benchmarks have evaluated large language model (LLM)-based UAV agents in reasoning, navigation, and efficiency, systematic assessment of security, resilience, and trust under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored, particularly in emerging 6G-enabled settings. We introduce $α^{3}$-SecBench, the first large-scale evaluation suite for assessing the security-aware autonomy of LLM-based UAV agents under realistic adversarial interference. Building on multi-turn conversational UAV missions from $α^{3}$-Bench, the framework augments benign episodes with 20,000 validated security overlay attack scenarios targeting seven autonomy layers, including sensing, perception, planning, control, communication, edge/cloud infrastructure, and LLM reasoning. $α^{3}$-SecBench evaluates agents across three orthogonal dimensions: security (attack detection and vulnerability attribution), resilience (safe degradation behavior), and trust (policy-compliant tool usage). We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LLMs from major industrial providers and leading AI labs using thousands of adversarially augmented UAV episodes sampled from a corpus of 113,475 missions spanning 175 threat types. While many models reliably detect anomalous behavior, effective mitigation, vulnerability attribution, and trustworthy control actions remain inconsistent. Normalized overall scores range from 12.9% to 57.1%, highlighting a significant gap between anomaly detection and security-aware autonomous decision-making. We release $α^{3}$-SecBench on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/AlphaSecBench</p></details> |  |

Existing document poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious documents into the knowledge base to manipulate RAG outputs, rely primarily on unrealistic white-box or gray-box assumptions, limiting their practical applicability. To address this gap, we propose CtrlRAG, a two-stage black-box attack that (1) constructs malicious documents containing misinformation or emotion-inducing content and injects them into the knowledge base, and (2) iteratively optimizes them using a localization algorithm and Masked Language Model (MLM) guided on reference context feedback, ensuring their retrieval priority while preserving linguistic naturalness. With only five malicious documents per target question injected into the million-document MS MARCO dataset, CtrlRAG achieves up to 90% attack success rates on commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), a 30% improvement over optimal baselines, in both *Emotion Manipulation* and *Hallucination Amplification* tasks. Furthermore, we show that existing defenses fail to balance security and performance. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a dynamic *Knowledge Expansion* defense strategy based on *Parametric/Non-parametric Memory Confrontation*, blocking 78% of attacks while maintaining 95.5% system accuracy. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG systems and provide effective defense strategies.</p></details> |  |
